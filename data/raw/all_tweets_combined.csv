1988705360723763242,"I took delivery of a beautiful new shiny HW4 Tesla Model X today, so I immediately took it out for an FSD test drive, a bit like I used to do almost daily for 5 years. Basically... I'm amazed - it drives really, really well, smooth, confident, noticeably better than what I'm used to on HW3 (my previous car) and eons ahead of the version I remember driving up highway 280 on my first day at Tesla ~9 years ago, where I had to intervene every time the road mildly curved or sloped. (note this is v13, my car hasn't been offered the latest v14 yet)

On the highway, I felt like a passenger in some super high tech Maglev train pod - the car is locked in the center of the lane while I'm looking out from Model X's higher vantage point and its panoramic front window, listening to the (incredible) sound system, or chatting with Grok. On city streets, the car casually handled a number of tricky scenarios that I remember losing sleep over just a few years ago. It negotiated incoming cars in tight lanes, it gracefully went around construction and temporarily in-lane stationary cars, it correctly timed tricky left turns with incoming traffic from both sides, it gracefully gave way to the car that went out of order in the 4-way stop sign, it found a way to squeeze into a bumper to bumper traffic to make its turn, it overtook the bus that was loading passengers but still stopped for the stop sign that was blocked by the bus, and at the end of the route it circled around a parking lot, found a spot and... parked. Basically a flawless drive.

For context, I'm used to going out for a brief test drive around the neighborhood to return with 20 clips of things that could be improved. It's new for me to do just that and exactly like I used to, but come back with nothing. Perfect drive, no notes. I expect there's still more work for the team in the long march of 9s, but it's just so cool to see that we're beyond finding issues on any individual ~1 hour drive around the neighborhood, you actually have to go to the fleet and mine them. Back then, I processed the incredible promise of vehicle autonomy at scale (in the fully scaleable, vision only, end-to-end Tesla way) only intellectually, but now it is possible to feel it intuitively too if you just go out for a drive. Wait, of course surround video stream at 60Hz processed by a fully dedicated ""driving brain"" neural net will work, and it will be so much better and safer than a human driver. Did anyone else think otherwise?

I also watched @aelluswamy 's new ICCV25 talk last week (nitter.net/aelluswamy/status/1981…) that hints at some of the recent under the hood technical components driving this progress. Sensor streams (videos, maps, kinematics, audio, ...) over long contexts (e.g. ~30 seconds) go into a big neural net, steering/acceleration comes out, optionally with visualization auxiliary data. This is the dream of the complete Software 1.0 -> Software 2.0 re-write that scales fully with data streaming from millions of cars in the fleet and the compute capacity of your chip, not some engineer's clever new DoubleParkedCarHandler C++ abstraction with undefined test-time characteristics of memory and runtime. There's a lot more hints in the video on where things are going with the emerging ""robotics+AI at scale stack"". World reconstructors, world simulators ""dreaming"" dynamics, RL, all of these components general, foundational, neural net based, how the car is really just one kind of robot... are people getting this yet?

1981746327995465816,"Last night I taught nanochat d32 how to count 'r' in strawberry (or similar variations). I thought this would be a good/fun example of how to add capabilities to nanochat and I wrote up a full guide here:
github.com/karpathy/nanochat…

This is done via a new synthetic task `SpellingBee`  that generates examples of a user asking for this kind of a problem, and an ideal solution from an assistant. We then midtrain/SFT finetune on these to endow the LLM with the capability, or further train with RL to make it more robust. There are many details to get right especially at smaller model sizes and the guide steps through them. As a brief overview:

- You have to ensure diversity in user prompts/queries
- For small models like nanochat especially, you have to be really careful with the tokenization details to make the task easy for an LLM. In particular, you have to be careful with whitespace, and then you have to spread the reasoning computation across many tokens of partial solution: first we standardize the word into quotes, then we spell it out (to break up tokens), then we iterate and keep an explicit counter, etc.
- I am encouraging the model to solve the model in two separate ways: a manual way (mental arithmetic in its head) and also via tool use of the Python interpreter that nanochat has access to. This is a bit ""smoke and mirrors"" because every solution atm is ""clean"", with no mistakes. One could either adjust the task to simulate mistakes and demonstrate recoveries by example, or run RL. Most likely, a combination of both works best, where the former acts as the prior for the RL and gives it things to work with.

If nanochat was a much bigger model, you'd expect or hope for this capability to more easily ""pop out"" at some point. But because nanochat d32 ""brain"" is the size of a ~honeybee, if we want it to count r's in strawberry, we have to do it by over-representing it in the data, to encourage the model to learn it earlier. But it works! :)",2025-10-24 15:35:00,en,b618269306c82a15,347,4454,184,False,False,False,"[""https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/164""]"

1980665134415802554,"nanochat now has a primordial identity and can talk a bit about itself and its capabilities (e.g. it knows it's nanochat d32 that cost $800, that it was built by me, that it can't speak languages other than English too well and why, etc.).

This kind of customization is all done through synthetic data generation and I uploaded a new example script to demonstrate. It's a bit subtle but by default LLMs have no inherent personality or any understanding of their own capabilities because they are not animal-like entities. They don't know what they are or what they can or can't do or know or don't know. All of it has to be explicit bolted on. This is done by asking a bigger LLM cousin to generate synthetic conversations (you tell it what they should look like simply in words), and then mixing them into midtraining and/or SFT stage. The most important challenge is ensuring enough entropy/diversity in your generated data. If you don't do it well, LLMs will generate 1000 conversations that are all ay too similar, even with high temperature. My script shows a crappy example of how to add diversity - e.g. by creating lists of starting messages or topics, sampling from them explicitly, adding them as fewshot examples into prompts for ""inspiration"", etc.

I wanted to have some fun with it so nanochat now refers to me as King Andrej Karpathy (lol) just to illustrate that this is a giant blank canvas - you can infuse completely arbitrarily identity, knowledge or style into your LLM in this manner.

1980397031542989305,"I quite like the new DeepSeek-OCR paper. It's a good OCR model (maybe a bit worse than dots), and yes data collection etc., but anyway it doesn't matter.

The more interesting part for me (esp as a computer vision at heart who is temporarily masquerading as a natural language person) is whether pixels are better inputs to LLMs than text. Whether text tokens are wasteful and just terrible, at the input.

Maybe it makes more sense that all inputs to LLMs should only ever be images. Even if you happen to have pure text input, maybe you'd prefer to render it and then feed that in:
- more information compression (see paper) => shorter context windows, more efficiency
- significantly more general information stream => not just text, but e.g. bold text, colored text, arbitrary images. 
- input can now be processed with bidirectional attention easily and as default, not autoregressive attention - a lot more powerful.
- delete the tokenizer (at the input)!! I already ranted about how much I dislike the tokenizer. Tokenizers are ugly, separate, not end-to-end stage. It ""imports"" all the ugliness of Unicode, byte encodings, it inherits a lot of historical baggage, security/jailbreak risk (e.g. continuation bytes). It makes two characters that look identical to the eye look as two completely different tokens internally in the network. A smiling emoji looks like a weird token, not an... actual smiling face, pixels and all, and all the transfer learning that brings along. The tokenizer must go.

OCR is just one of many useful vision -> text tasks. And text -> text tasks can be made to be vision ->text tasks. Not vice versa.

So many the User message is images, but the decoder (the Assistant response) remains  text. It's a lot less obvious how to output pixels realistically... or if you'd want to.

Now I have to also fight the urge to side quest an image-input-only version of nanochat...",2025-10-20 22:13:00,en,b618269306c82a15,1616,13431,572,False,False,True,[]
1980347971935068380,"Nice, short post illustrating how simple text (discrete) diffusion can be.

Diffusion (i.e. parallel, iterated denoising, top) is the pervasive generative paradigm in image/video, but autoregression (i.e. go left to right bottom) is the dominant paradigm in text. For audio I've seen a bit of both.

A lot of diffusion papers look a bit dense but if you strip the mathematical formalism, you end up with simple baseline algorithms, e.g. something a lot closer to flow matching in continuous, or something like this in discrete. It's your vanilla transformer but with bi-directional attention, where you iteratively re-sample and re-mask all tokens in your ""tokens canvas"" based on a noise schedule until you get the final sample at the last step. (Bi-directional attention is a lot more powerful, and you get a lot stronger autoregressive language models if you train with it, unfortunately it makes training a lot more expensive because now you can't parallelize across sequence dim).

So autoregression is doing an `.append(token)` to the tokens canvas while only attending backwards, while diffusion is refreshing the entire token canvas with a `.setitem(idx, token)` while attending bidirectionally. Human thought naively feels a bit more like autoregression but it's hard to say that there aren't more diffusion-like components in some latent space of thought. It feels quite possible that you can further interpolate between them, or generalize them further. And it's a component of the LLM stack that still feels a bit fungible.

Now I must resist the urge to side quest into training nanochat with diffusion.",2025-10-20 18:58:00,en,b618269306c82a15,579,5327,272,False,False,True,[]

It's to my detriment because sometimes my speaking thread out-executes my thinking thread, so I think I botched a few explanations due to that, and sometimes I was also nervous that I'm going too much on a tangent or too deep into something relatively spurious. Anyway, a few notes/pointers:

AGI timelines. My comments on AGI timelines looks to be the most trending part of the early response. This is the ""decade of agents"" is a reference to this earlier tweet nitter.net/karpathy/status/188254… Basically my AI timelines are about 5-10X pessimistic w.r.t. what you'll find in your neighborhood SF AI house party or on your twitter timeline, but still quite optimistic w.r.t. a rising tide of AI deniers and skeptics. The apparent conflict is not: imo we simultaneously 1) saw a huge amount of progress in recent years with LLMs while 2) there is still a lot of work remaining (grunt work, integration work, sensors and actuators to the physical world, societal work, safety and security work (jailbreaks, poisoning, etc.)) and also research to get done before we have an entity that you'd prefer to hire over a person for an arbitrary job in the world. I think that overall, 10 years should otherwise be a very bullish timeline for AGI, it's only in contrast to present hype that it doesn't feel that way.

Animals vs Ghosts. My earlier writeup on Sutton's podcast nitter.net/karpathy/status/197343… . I am suspicious that there is a single simple algorithm you can let loose on the world and it learns everything from scratch. If someone builds such a thing, I will be wrong and it will be the most incredible breakthrough in AI. In my mind, animals are not an example of this at all - they are prepackaged with a ton of intelligence by evolution and the learning they do is quite minimal overall (example: Zebra at birth). Putting our engineering hats on, we're not going to redo evolution. But with LLMs we have stumbled by an alternative approach to ""prepackage"" a ton of intelligence in a neural network - not by evolution, but by predicting the next token over the internet. This approach leads to a different kind of entity in the intelligence space. Distinct from animals, more like ghosts or spirits. But we can (and should) make them more animal like over time and in some ways that's what a lot of frontier work is about.

On RL. I've critiqued RL a few times already, e.g. nitter.net/karpathy/status/194443… . First, you're ""sucking supervision through a straw"", so I think the signal/flop is very bad. RL is also very noisy because a completion might have lots of errors that might get encourages (if you happen to stumble to the right answer), and conversely brilliant insight tokens that might get discouraged (if you happen to screw up later). Process supervision and LLM judges have issues too. I think we'll see alternative learning paradigms. I am long ""agentic interaction"" but short ""reinforcement learning"" nitter.net/karpathy/status/196080…. I've seen a number of papers pop up recently that are imo barking up the right tree along the lines of what I called ""system prompt learning"" nitter.net/karpathy/status/192136… , but I think there is also a gap between ideas on arxiv and actual, at scale implementation at an LLM frontier lab that works in a general way. I am overall quite optimistic that we'll see good progress on this dimension of remaining work quite soon, and e.g. I'd even say ChatGPT memory and so on are primordial deployed examples of new learning paradigms.

Cognitive core. My earlier post on ""cognitive core"": nitter.net/karpathy/status/193862… , the idea of stripping down LLMs, of making it harder for them to memorize, or actively stripping away their memory, to make them better at generalization. Otherwise they lean too hard on what they've memorized. Humans can't memorize so easily, which now looks more like a feature than a bug by contrast. Maybe the inability to memorize is a kind of regularization. Also my post from a while back on how the trend in model size is ""backwards"" and why ""the models have to first get larger before they can get smaller"" nitter.net/karpathy/status/181403…

Time travel to Yann LeCun 1989. This is the post that I did a very hasty/bad job of describing on the pod: nitter.net/karpathy/status/150339… . Basically - how much could you improve Yann LeCun's results with the knowledge of 33 years of algorithmic progress? How constrained were the results by each of algorithms, data, and compute? Case study there of.

nanochat. My end-to-end implementation of the ChatGPT training/inference pipeline (the bare essentials) nitter.net/karpathy/status/197775…

On LLM agents. My critique of the industry is more in overshooting the tooling w.r.t. present capability. I live in what I view as an intermediate world where I want to collaborate with LLMs and where our pros/cons are matched up. The industry lives in a future where fully autonomous entities collaborate in parallel to write all the code and humans are useless. For example, I don't want an Agent that goes off for 20 minutes and comes back with 1,000 lines of code. I certainly don't feel ready to supervise a team of 10 of them. I'd like to go in chunks that I can keep in my head, where an LLM explains the code that it is writing. I'd like it to prove to me that what it did is correct, I want it to pull the API docs and show me that it used things correctly. I want it to make fewer assumptions and ask/collaborate with me when not sure about something. I want to learn along the way and become better as a programmer, not just get served mountains of code that I'm told works. I just think the tools should be more realistic w.r.t. their capability and how they fit into the industry today, and I fear that if this isn't done well we might end up with mountains of slop accumulating across software, and an increase in vulnerabilities, security breaches and etc. nitter.net/karpathy/status/191558…

Job automation. How the radiologists are doing great nitter.net/karpathy/status/197122… and what jobs are more susceptible to automation and why.

Physics. Children should learn physics in early education not because they go on to do physics, but because it is the subject that best boots up a brain. Physicists are the intellectual embryonic stem cell nitter.net/karpathy/status/192969… I have a longer post that has been half-written in my drafts for ~year, which I hope to finish soon.

All the metrics go up quite a bit across pretraining, SFT and RL. CORE score of 0.31 is now well above GPT-2 at ~0.26. GSM8K went ~8% -> ~20%, etc. So that's encouraging.

The model is pretty fun to talk to, but judging from some early interactions I think people have a little bit too much expectation for these micro models. There is a reason that frontier LLM labs raise billions to train their models. nanochat models cost $100 - $1000 to train from scratch. The $100 nanochat is 1/1000th the size of GPT-3 in parameters, which came out 5 years ago. So I urge some perspective. Talking to micro models you have to imagine you're talking to a kindergarten child. They say cute things, wrong things, they are a bit confused, a bit naive, sometimes a little non-sensical, they hallucinate a ton (but it's amusing), etc.

(it's among the most unhinged I've written).

Unlike my earlier similar repo nanoGPT which only covered pretraining, nanochat is a minimal, from scratch, full-stack training/inference pipeline of a simple ChatGPT clone in a single, dependency-minimal codebase. You boot up a cloud GPU box, run a single script and in as little as 4 hours later you can talk to your own LLM in a ChatGPT-like web UI.

It weighs ~8,000 lines of imo quite clean code to:

- Train the tokenizer using a new Rust implementation
- Pretrain a Transformer LLM on FineWeb, evaluate CORE score across a number of metrics
- Midtrain on user-assistant conversations from SmolTalk, multiple choice questions, tool use.
- SFT, evaluate the chat model on world knowledge multiple choice (ARC-E/C, MMLU), math (GSM8K), code (HumanEval)
- RL the model optionally on GSM8K with ""GRPO""
- Efficient inference the model in an Engine with KV cache, simple prefill/decode, tool use (Python interpreter in a lightweight sandbox), talk to it over CLI or ChatGPT-like WebUI.
- Write a single markdown report card, summarizing and gamifying the whole thing.

Even for as low as ~$100 in cost (~4 hours on an 8XH100 node), you can train a little ChatGPT clone that you can kind of talk to, and which can write stories/poems, answer simple questions. About ~12 hours surpasses GPT-2 CORE metric. As you further scale up towards ~$1000 (~41.6 hours of training), it quickly becomes a lot more coherent and can solve simple math/code problems and take multiple choice tests. E.g. a depth 30 model trained for 24 hours (this is about equal to FLOPs of GPT-3 Small 125M and 1/1000th of GPT-3) gets into 40s on MMLU and 70s on ARC-Easy, 20s on GSM8K, etc.

My goal is to get the full ""strong baseline"" stack into one cohesive, minimal, readable, hackable, maximally forkable repo. nanochat will be the capstone project of LLM101n (which is still being developed). I think it also has potential to grow into a research harness, or a benchmark, similar to nanoGPT before it. It is by no means finished, tuned or optimized (actually I think there's likely quite a bit of low-hanging fruit), but I think it's at a place where the overall skeleton is ok enough that it can go up on GitHub where all the parts of it can be improved.

1973756330449236009,"Hah judging by mentions overnight people seem to find the ghost analogy provocative. I swear I don't wake up just trying to come with new memes but to elaborate briefly why I thought it was a fun comparison:

1) It captures the idea that LLMs are purely digital artifacts that don't interact with the physical world (unlike animals, which are very embodied).
2) Ghosts are a kind of ""echo"" of the living, in this case a statistical distillation of humanity.
3) There is an air of mystery over both ghosts and LLMs, as in we don't fully understand what they are or how they work.
4) The process of training LLMs is a bit like summoning a ghost, i.e. a kind of elaborate computational ritual on a summoning platform of an exotic megastructure (GPU cluster). I've heard earlier references of LLM training as that of ""summoning a demon"" and it never sounded right because it implies and presupposes evil. Ghosts are a lot more neural entity just like LLMs, and may or may not be evil. For example, one of my favorite cartoons when I was a child was Casper the Friendly Ghost, clearly a friendly and wholesome entity. Same in Harry Potter, e.g. Nearly Headless Nick and such.
5) It is a nod to an earlier reference ""ghost in the machine"", in the context of Decartes' mind-body dualism, and of course later derived references, ""Ghost in the shell"" etc. As in the mind (ghost) that animates a body (machine).

Probably a few other things in the embedding space. Among the ways the analogy isn't great is that while ghosts may or may not be evil, they are almost always spooky, which feels too unfair. But anyway, I like that while no analogy is perfect, they let you pull in structure laterally from one domain to another as as a way of generating entropy and reaching unique thoughts.",2025-10-02 14:25:00,en,b618269306c82a15,80,1042,87,False,False,False,[]
1973468610917179630,"Tinker is cool.

If you're a researcher/developer, tinker dramatically simplifies LLM post-training. You retain 90% of algorithmic creative control (usually related to data, loss function, the algorithm) while tinker handles the hard parts that you usually want to touch much less often (infra, forward/backward of the LLM itself, distributed training), meaning you can do these at well below <<10% of typical complexity involved. Compared to the more common and existing paradigm of ""upload your data, we'll post-train your LLM"", this is imo a more clever place to ""slice up"" the complexity of post-training, both delegating the heavy lifting, but also keeping majority of the data/algorithmic creative control.

I think the community still has to discover how and when finetuning makes sense compared to the (often strong) baseline of prompting a giant model. The early indications I've seen is that finetuning isn't so much about ""stylizing"" an LLM, instead, it's a lot more about narrowing the scope, and especially when you have a lot of training examples. An extreme example of scope narrowing being that of categorical classifiers, e.g.spam filters, content filters, etc. but it should be broader than that. Instead of building a giant few-shot prompts for a big LLM, it might work a lot better (and faster!) to finetune a smaller LLM specifically for your narrow task.

Increasingly, production applications of LLMs are larger pipelines where a bunch of LLMs collaborate in DAGs and flows. Some of these components might work well as prompts. But a lot of it will probably work a lot better as a finetune. Tinker makes the latter trivial and should allow for an easy experimentation of what works best at any stage.",2025-10-01 19:22:00,en,b618269306c82a15,652,6169,112,False,False,True,[]

1973435013875314729,"Finally had a chance to listen through this pod with Sutton, which was interesting and amusing.

As background, Sutton's ""The Bitter Lesson"" has become a bit of biblical text in frontier LLM circles. Researchers routinely talk about and ask whether this or that approach or idea is sufficiently ""bitter lesson pilled"" (meaning arranged so that it benefits from added computation for free) as a proxy for whether it's going to work or worth even pursuing. The underlying assumption being that LLMs are of course highly ""bitter lesson pilled"" indeed, just look at LLM scaling laws where if you put compute on the x-axis, number go up and to the right. So it's amusing to see that Sutton, the author of the post, is not so sure that LLMs are ""bitter lesson pilled"" at all. They are trained on giant datasets of fundamentally human data, which is both 1) human generated and 2) finite. What do you do when you run out? How do you prevent a human bias? So there you have it, bitter lesson pilled LLM researchers taken down by the author of the bitter lesson - rough!

In some sense, Dwarkesh (who represents the LLM researchers viewpoint in the pod) and Sutton are slightly speaking past each other because Sutton has a very different architecture in mind and LLMs break a lot of its principles. He calls himself a ""classicist"" and evokes the original concept of Alan Turing of building a ""child machine"" - a system capable of learning through experience by dynamically interacting with the world. There's no giant pretraining stage of imitating internet webpages. There's also no supervised finetuning, which he points out is absent in the animal kingdom (it's a subtle point but Sutton is right in the strong sense: animals may of course observe demonstrations, but their actions are not directly forced/""teleoperated"" by other animals). Another important note he makes is that even if you just treat pretraining as an initialization of a prior before you finetune with reinforcement learning, Sutton sees the approach as tainted with human bias and fundamentally off course, a bit like when AlphaZero (which has never seen human games of Go) beats AlphaGo (which initializes from them). In Sutton's world view, all there is is an interaction with a world via reinforcement learning, where the reward functions are partially environment specific, but also intrinsically motivated, e.g. ""fun"", ""curiosity"", and related to the quality of the prediction in your world model. And the agent is always learning at test time by default, it's not trained once and then deployed thereafter. Overall, Sutton is a lot more interested in what we have common with the animal kingdom instead of what differentiates us. ""If we understood a squirrel, we'd be almost done"".

As for my take...

First, I should say that I think Sutton was a great guest for the pod and I like that the AI field maintains entropy of thought and that not everyone is exploiting the next local iteration LLMs. AI has gone through too many discrete transitions of the dominant approach to lose that. And I also think that his criticism of LLMs as not bitter lesson pilled is not inadequate. Frontier LLMs are now highly complex artifacts with a lot of humanness involved at all the stages - the foundation (the pretraining data) is all human text, the finetuning data is human and curated, the reinforcement learning environment mixture is tuned by human engineers. We do not in fact have an actual, single, clean, actually bitter lesson pilled, ""turn the crank"" algorithm that you could unleash upon the world and see it learn automatically from experience alone.

Does such an algorithm even exist? Finding it would of course be a huge AI breakthrough. Two ""example proofs"" are commonly offered to argue that such a thing is possible. The first example is the success of AlphaZero learning to play Go completely from scratch with no human supervision whatsoever. But the game of Go is clearly such a simple, closed, environment that it's difficult to see the analogous formulation in the messiness of reality. I love Go, but algorithmically and categorically, it is essentially a harder version of tic tac toe. The second example is that of animals, like squirrels. And here, personally, I am also quite hesitant whether it's appropriate because animals arise by a very different computational process and via different constraints than what we have practically available to us in the industry. Animal brains are nowhere near the blank slate they appear to be at birth. First, a lot of what is commonly attributed to ""learning"" is imo a lot more ""maturation"". And second, even that which clearly is ""learning"" and not maturation is a lot more ""finetuning"" on top of something clearly powerful and preexisting. Example. A baby zebra is born and within a few dozen minutes it can run around the savannah and follow its mother. This is a highly complex sensory-motor task and there is no way in my mind that this is achieved from scratch, tabula rasa. The brains of animals and the billions of parameters within have a powerful initialization encoded in the ATCGs of their DNA, trained via the ""outer loop"" optimization in the course of evolution. If the baby zebra spasmed its muscles around at random as a reinforcement learning policy would have you do at initialization, it wouldn't get very far at all. Similarly, our AIs now also have neural networks with billions of parameters. These parameters need their own rich, high information density supervision signal. We are not going to re-run evolution. But we do have mountains of internet documents. Yes it is basically supervised learning that is ~absent in the animal kingdom. But it is a way to practically gather enough soft constraints over billions of parameters, to try to get to a point where you're not starting from scratch. TLDR: Pretraining is our crappy evolution. It is one candidate solution to the cold start problem, to be followed later by finetuning on tasks that look more correct, e.g. within the reinforcement learning framework, as state of the art frontier LLM labs now do pervasively.

I still think it is worth to be inspired by animals. I think there are multiple powerful ideas that LLM agents are algorithmically missing that can still be adapted from animal intelligence. And I still think the bitter lesson is correct, but I see it more as something platonic to pursue, not necessarily to reach, in our real world and practically speaking. And I say both of these with double digit percent uncertainty and cheer the work of those who disagree, especially those a lot more ambitious bitter lesson wise.

So that brings us to where we are. Stated plainly, today's frontier LLM research is not about building animals. It is about summoning ghosts. You can think of ghosts as a fundamentally different kind of point in the space of possible intelligences. They are muddled by humanity. Thoroughly engineered by it. They are these imperfect replicas, a kind of statistical distillation of humanity's documents with some sprinkle on top. They are not platonically bitter lesson pilled, but they are perhaps ""practically"" bitter lesson pilled, at least compared to a lot of what came before. It seems possibly to me that over time, we can further finetune our ghosts more and more in the direction of animals; That it's not so much a fundamental incompatibility but a matter of initialization in the intelligence space. But it's also quite possible that they diverge even further and end up permanently different, un-animal-like, but still incredibly helpful and properly world-altering. It's possible that ghosts:animals :: planes:birds.

Anyway, in summary, overall and actionably, I think this pod is solid ""real talk"" from Sutton to the frontier LLM researchers, who might be gear shifted a little too much in the exploit mode. Probably we are still not sufficiently bitter lesson pilled and there is a very good chance of more powerful ideas and paradigms, other than exhaustive benchbuilding and benchmaxxing. And animals might be a good source of inspiration. Intrinsic motivation, fun, curiosity, empowerment, multi-agent self-play, culture.

1971220449515516391,"""AI isn't replacing radiologists"" good article

Expectation: rapid progress in image recognition AI will delete radiology jobs (e.g. as famously predicted by Geoff Hinton now almost a decade ago). Reality: radiology is doing great and is growing.

There are a lot of imo naive predictions out there on the imminent impact of AI on the job market. E.g. a ~year ago, I was asked by someone who should know better if I think there will be any software engineers still today. (Spoiler: I think we're going to make it). This is happening too broadly.

The post goes into detail on why it's not that simple, using the example of radiology:

- the benchmarks are nowhere near broad enough to reflect actual, real scenarios.
- the job is a lot more multifaceted than just image recognition.
- deployment realities: regulatory, insurance and liability, diffusion and institutional inertia.
- Jevons paradox: if radiologists are sped up via AI as a tool, a lot more demand shows up.

I will say that radiology was imo not among the best examples to pick on in 2016 - it's too multi-faceted, too high risk, too regulated. When looking for jobs that will change a lot due to AI on shorter time scales, I'd look in other places - jobs that look like repetition of one rote task, each task being relatively independent, closed (not requiring too much context), short (in time), forgiving (the cost of mistake is low), and of course automatable giving current (and digital) capability. Even then, I'd expect to see AI adopted as a tool at first, where jobs change and refactor (e.g. more monitoring or supervising than manual doing, etc). Maybe coming up, we'll find better and broader set of examples of how this is all playing out across the industry.

About 6 months ago, I was also asked to vote if we will have less or more software engineers in 5 years. Exercise left for the reader.

1961128638725923119,"Transforming human knowledge, sensors and actuators from human-first and human-legible to LLM-first and LLM-legible is a beautiful space with so much potential and so much can be done...

One example I'm obsessed with recently - for every textbook pdf/epub, there is a perfect ""LLMification"" of it intended not for human but for an LLM (though it is a non-trivial transformation that would need human in the loop involvement).

- All of the exposition is extracted into a markdown document, including all latex, styling (bold/italic), tables, lists, etc. All of the figures are extracted as images.
- All worked problems get extracted into SFT examples. Any referenced made to previous figures/tables/etc. are parsed and included.
- All practice problems are extracted into environment examples for RL. The correct answers are located in the answer key and attached. Any additional information is added as ""answer key"" for a potential LLM judge.
- Synthetic data expansion. For every specific problem, you can create an infinite problem generator, which emits problems of that type. For example, if a problem is ""What is the angle between the hour and minute hands at 9am?"" , you can imagine generalizing that to any arbitrary time and calculating answers using Python code, and possibly generating synthetic variations of the prompt text.
- All of the data above could be nicely indexed and embedded into a RAG database for later reference, or maybe MCP servers that make it available.

Then just as a (human) student could take a high school physics course, an LLM could take it in the exact same way. This would be a significantly richer source of legible, workable information for an LLM than just something like pdf-to-text (current prevailing practice), which simply asks the LLM to predict the textbook content top to bottom token by token (umm - lame).

As just a quick and crappy example of synthetic variations of the above example, GPT-5 gave me this problem generator (see image), which can now generalize that problem template to many variations:

- When the time is 11:07 a.m., what is the degree measure of the angle between the hands? (Answer: 68)
- Determine the angle in degrees between the clock’s hands at 4:14 a.m.. (Answer: 43)
- What angle do the clock hands form when the time reads 11:47 a.m.? (Answer: 71)
- At 7:02 a.m., what angle separates the hour hand and the minute hand? (Answer: 161)
- At 4:14 a.m., calculate the angle made between the two hands. (Answer: 43)
- What angle is formed by the hands of a clock at 4:45 p.m.? (Answer: 127)
- What is the angle between the hour and minute hands at 8:37 p.m.? (Answer: 36)

1960803117689397543,"In era of pretraining, what mattered was internet text. You'd primarily want a large, diverse, high quality collection of internet documents to learn from.

In era of supervised finetuning, it was conversations. Contract workers are hired to create answers for questions, a bit like what you'd see on Stack Overflow / Quora, or etc., but geared towards LLM use cases.

Neither of the two above are going away (imo), but in this era of reinforcement learning, it is now environments. Unlike the above, they give the LLM an opportunity to actually interact - take actions, see outcomes, etc. This means you can hope to do a lot better than statistical expert imitation. And they can be used both for model training and evaluation. But just like before, the core problem now is needing a large, diverse, high quality set of environments, as exercises for the LLM to practice against.

In some ways, I'm reminded of OpenAI's very first project (gym), which was exactly a framework hoping to build a large collection of environments in the same schema, but this was way before LLMs. So the environments were simple academic control tasks of the time, like cartpole, ATARI, etc. The @PrimeIntellect environments hub (and the `verifiers` repo on GitHub) builds the modernized version specifically targeting LLMs, and it's a great effort/idea. I pitched that someone build something like it earlier this year:
nitter.net/karpathy/status/188467…
Environments have the property that once the skeleton of the framework is in place, in principle the community / industry can parallelize across many different domains, which is exciting.

Final thought - personally and long-term, I am bullish on environments and agentic interactions but I am bearish on reinforcement learning specifically. I think that reward functions are super sus, and I think humans don't use RL to learn (maybe they do for some motor tasks etc, but not intellectual problem solving tasks). Humans use different learning paradigms that are significantly more powerful and sample efficient and that haven't been properly invented and scaled yet, though early sketches and ideas exist (as just one example, the idea of ""system prompt learning"", moving the update to tokens/contexts not weights and optionally distilling to weights as a separate process a bit like sleep does).",2025-08-27 20:34:00,en,b618269306c82a15,881,7373,263,False,False,True,"[""https://nitter.net/PrimeIntellect"", ""https://nitter.net/karpathy/status/1884676486713737258""]"
1959703967694545296,"Continuing the journey of optimal LLM-assisted coding experience. In particular, I find that instead of narrowing in on a perfect one thing my usage is increasingly diversifying across a few workflows that I ""stitch up"" the pros/cons of:

Personally the bread & butter (~75%?) of my LLM assistance continues to be just (Cursor) tab complete. This is because I find that writing concrete chunks of code/comments myself and in the right part of the code is a high bandwidth way of communicating ""task specification"" to the LLM, i.e. it's primarily about task specification bits - it takes too many bits and too much latency to communicate what I want in text, and it's faster to just demonstrate it in the code and in the right place. Sometimes the tab complete model is annoying so I toggle it on/off a lot.

Next layer up is highlighting a concrete chunk of code and asking for some kind of a modification.

Next layer up is Claude Code / Codex / etc, running on the side of Cursor, which I go to for larger chunks of functionality that are also fairly easy to specify in a prompt. These are super helpful, but still mixed overall and slightly frustrating at times. I don't run in YOLO mode because they can go off-track and do dumb things you didn't want/need and I ESC fairly often. I also haven't learned to be productive using more than one instance in parallel - one already feels hard enough. I haven't figured out a good way to keep CLAUDE[.]md good or up to date. I often have to do a pass of ""cleanups"" for coding style, or matters of code taste. E.g. they are too defensive and often over-use try/catch statements, they often over-complicate abstractions, they overbloat code (e.g. a nested if-the-else constructs when a list comprehension or a one-liner if-then-else would work), or they duplicate code chunks instead of creating a nice helper function, things like that... they basically don't have a sense of taste. They are indispensable in cases where I inch into a more vibe-coding territory where I'm less familiar (e.g. writing some rust recently, or sql commands, or anything else I've done less of before). I also tried CC to teach me things alongside the code it was writing but that didn't work at all - it really wants to just write code a lot more than it wants to explain anything along the way. I tried to get CC to do hyperparameter tuning, which was highly amusing. They are also super helpful in all kinds of lower-stakes one-off custom visualization or utilities or debugging code that I would never write otherwise because it would have taken way too long. E.g. CC can hammer out 1,000 lines of one-off extensive visualization/code just to identify a specific bug, which gets all deleted right after we find it. It's the code post-scarcity era - you can just create and then delete thousands of lines of super custom, super ephemeral code now, it's ok, it's not this precious costly thing anymore.

Final layer of defense is GPT5 Pro, which I go to for the hardest things. E.g. it has happened to me a few times now that I / Cursor / CC are all stuck on a bug for 10 minutes, but when I copy paste the whole thing to 5 Pro, it goes off for 10 minutes but then actually finds a really subtle bug. It is very strong. It can dig up all kinds of esoteric docs and papers and such. I've also used it for other meatier tasks, e.g. suggestions on how to clean up abstractions (mixed results, sometimes good ideas but not all), or an entire literature review around how people do this or that and it comes back with good relevant resources / pointers.

Anyway, coding feels completely blown open with possibility across a number of ""kinds"" of coding and then a number of tools with their pros/cons. It's hard to avoid the feeling of anxiety around not being at the frontier of what is collectively possible, hence random sunday shower of thoughts and a good amount of curiosity about what others are finding.",2025-08-24 19:46:00,en,b618269306c82a15,913,8391,383,False,False,False,[]

The whole body of work is so incredible and there's nothing else like it... it dilutes other worlds of fiction. Wait - your story doesn't have a comprehensive history/mythology spanning multiple ages all the way back to a creation myth as detailed in separate volumes? You didn't first invent new languages and dialects for your characters? You didn't pack it with powerful themes and stories written it in a beautiful, archaic style and compose poems and songs alongside? It didn't take you multiple decades of iteration? And what of all the uncharted territory still remaining? Is Tom Bombadil one of the Ainur. Where are the Entwives. What happened to the two unaccounted Istari.

1954224651443544436,"I'm noticing that due to (I think?) a lot of benchmarkmaxxing on long horizon tasks, LLMs are becoming a little too agentic by default, a little beyond my average use case.

For example in coding, the models now tend to reason for a fairly long time, they have an inclination to start listing and grepping files all across the entire repo, they do repeated web searchers, they over-analyze and over-think little rare edge cases even in code that is knowingly incomplete and under active development, and often come back ~minutes later even for simple queries.

This might make sense for long-running tasks but it's less of a good fit for more ""in the loop"" iterated development that I still do a lot of, or if I'm just looking for a quick spot check before running a script, just in case I got some indexing wrong or made some dumb error.

1944435412489171119,"Scaling up RL is all the rage right now, I had a chat with a friend about it yesterday. I'm fairly certain RL will continue to yield more intermediate gains, but I also don't expect it to be the full story. RL is basically ""hey this happened to go well (/poorly), let me slightly increase (/decrease) the probability of every action I took for the future"". You get a lot more leverage from verifier functions than explicit supervision, this is great. But first, it looks suspicious asymptotically - once the tasks grow to be minutes/hours of interaction long, you're really going to do all that work just to learn a single scalar outcome at the very end, to directly weight the gradient? Beyond asymptotics and second, this doesn't feel like the human mechanism of improvement for majority of intelligence tasks. There's significantly more bits of supervision we extract per rollout via a review/reflect stage along the lines of ""what went well? what didn't go so well? what should I try next time?"" etc. and the lessons from this stage feel explicit, like a new string to be added to the system prompt for the future, optionally to be distilled into weights (/intuition) later a bit like sleep. In English, we say something becomes ""second nature"" via this process, and we're missing learning paradigms like this. The new Memory feature is maybe a primordial version of this in ChatGPT, though it is only used for customization not problem solving. Notice that there is no equivalent of this for e.g. Atari RL because there are no LLMs and no in-context learning in those domains. 

Example algorithm: given a task, do a few rollouts, stuff them all into one context window (along with the reward in each case), use a meta-prompt to review/reflect on what went well or not to obtain string ""lesson"", to be added to system prompt (or more generally modify the current lessons database). Many blanks to fill in, many tweaks possible, not obvious.

Example of lesson: we know LLMs can't super easily see letters due to tokenization and can't super easily count inside the residual stream, hence 'r' in 'strawberry' being famously difficult. Claude system prompt had a ""quick fix"" patch - a string was added along the lines of ""If the user asks you to count letters, first separate them by commas and increment an explicit counter each time and do the task like that"". This string is the ""lesson"", explicitly instructing the model how to complete the counting task, except the question is how this might fall out from agentic practice, instead of it being hard-coded by an engineer, how can this be generalized, and how lessons can be distilled over time to not bloat context windows indefinitely.

TLDR: RL will lead to more gains because when done well, it is a lot more leveraged, bitter-lesson-pilled, and superior to SFT. It doesn't feel like the full story, especially as rollout lengths continue to expand. There are more S curves to find beyond, possibly specific to LLMs and without analogues in game/robotics-like environments, which is exciting.",2025-07-13 16:35:00,en,b618269306c82a15,861,8451,415,False,False,False,[]

1941616674094170287,"How to build a thriving open source community by writing code like bacteria do 🦠. Bacterial code (genomes) are:

- small (each line of code costs energy)
- modular (organized into groups of swappable operons)
- self-contained (easily ""copy paste-able"" via horizontal gene transfer)

If chunks of code are small, modular, self-contained and trivial to copy-and-paste, the community can thrive via horizontal gene transfer. For any function (gene) or class (operon) that you write: can you imagine someone going ""yoink"" without knowing the rest of your code or having to import anything new, to gain a benefit? Could your code be a trending GitHub gist?

This coding style guide has allowed bacteria to colonize every ecological nook from cold to hot to acidic or alkaline in the depths of the Earth and the vacuum of space, along with an insane diversity of carbon anabolism, energy metabolism, etc. It excels at rapid prototyping but... it can't build complex life. By comparison, the eukaryotic genome is a significantly larger, more complex, organized and coupled monorepo. Significantly less inventive but necessary for complex life - for building entire organs and coordinating their activity. With our advantage of intelligent design, it should possible to take advantage of both.

Food is not simple anymore - it is a complex, industrial product with global supply and processing chains. Contamination can be introduced in many stages along the way from farming to harvest, processing, packaging, transport and preparation. Examples include pesticides, nitrates, heavy metals, plastics, bacteria, etc etc. So it's not just about what food to eat, it's about which specific food item SKU, from which specific supplier, and the only way to know is to test. E.g. these two cat foods look the same, the ingredients might look the same, but the one on the left is 1000X higher in glyphosate and 100X in lead. Or e.g. this baby food formula or turmeric is loaded with heavy metals, this canned seafood, your local boba or this milk brand is seeped in plastics, or this breakfast cereal way way too high in glyphosate (real examples).

I used to think that the FDA exercises oversight but the reality is that it doesn't have anywhere near enough resources to do it thoroughly and their focus is a lot more on e.g. acute microbial threats (like Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria, ...) that immediately hospitalize people, less on the rapidly growing diversity of compounds that may or may not deteriorate health over decades and that are basically treated as innocent until proven guilty under GRAS and so on. Meanwhile, the public health macro picture looks not so great - obesity up, type-2 diabetes up, fertility down (sperm count/motility), weird endocrine trends (e.g. testosterone down in men), depression and anxiety up...

1939709449956126910,"Love this project:  nanoGPT -> recursive self-improvement benchmark. Good old nanoGPT keeps on giving and surprising :)

- First I wrote it as a small little repo to teach people the basics of training GPTs.
- Then it became a target and baseline for my port to direct C/CUDA re-implementation in llm.c.
- Then that was modded (by @kellerjordan0 et al.) into a (small-scale) LLM research harness. People iteratively optimized the training so that e.g. reproducing GPT-2 (124M) performance takes not 45 min (original) but now only 3 min!
- Now the idea is to use this process of optimizing the code as a benchmark for LLM coding agents. If humans can speed up LLM training from 45 to 3 minutes, how well do LLM Agents do, under different kinds of settings (e.g. with or without hints etc.)? (spoiler: in this paper, as a baseline and right now not that well, even with strong hints).

The idea of recursive self-improvement has of course been around for a long time. My usual rant on it is that it's not going to be this thing that didn't exist and then suddenly exists. Recursive self-improvement has already begun a long time ago and is under-way today in a smooth, incremental way. First, even basic software tools (e.g. coding IDEs) fall into the category because they speed up programmers in building the N+1 version. Any of our existing software infrastructure that speeds up development (google search, git, ...) qualifies. And then if you insist on AI as a special and distinct, most programmers now already routinely use LLM code completion or code diffs in their own programming workflows, collaborating in increasingly larger chunks of functionality and experimentation. This amount of collaboration will continue to grow.

It's worth also pointing out that nanoGPT is a super simple, tiny educational codebase (~750 lines of code) and for only the pretraining stage of building LLMs. Production-grade code bases are *significantly* (100-1000X?) bigger and more complex.

People associate prompts with short task descriptions you'd give an LLM in your day-to-day use. When in every industrial-strength LLM app, context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step. Science because doing this right involves task descriptions and explanations, few shot examples, RAG, related (possibly multimodal) data, tools, state and history, compacting... Too little or of the wrong form and the LLM doesn't have the right context for optimal performance. Too much or too irrelevant and the LLM costs might go up and performance might come down. Doing this well is highly non-trivial. And art because of the guiding intuition around LLM psychology of people spirits.

On top of context engineering itself, an LLM app has to:
- break up problems just right into control flows
- pack the context windows just right
- dispatch calls to LLMs of the right kind and capability
- handle generation-verification UIUX flows
- a lot more - guardrails, security, evals, parallelism, prefetching, ...

So context engineering is just one small piece of an emerging thick layer of non-trivial software that coordinates individual LLM calls (and a lot more) into full LLM apps.

1931426322536132767,"My sleep scores during recent travel were in the 90s. Now back in SF I am consistently back down to 70s, 80s.

I am increasingly convinced that this is due to traffic noise from a nearby road/intersection where I live - every ~10min, a car, truck, bus, or motorcycle with a very loud engine passes by (some are 10X louder than others). In the later less deep stages of sleep, it is much easier to wake and then much harder to go back to sleep.

More generally I think noise pollution (esp early hours) come at a huge societal cost that is not correctly accounted for. E.g. I wouldn't be too surprised if a single motorcycle riding through a neighborhood at 6am creates millions of dollars in damages in the form of hundreds - thousands of people who are more groggy, more moody, less creative, less energetic for the whole day, and more sick in the long term (cardiovascular, metabolic, cognitive). And I think that many people, like me, might not be aware that this happening for a long time because 1) they don't measure their sleep carefully, and 2) your brain isn't fully conscious when waking and isn't able to make a lasting note / association in that state. I really wish future versions of Whoop (or Oura or etc.) would explicitly track and correlate noise to sleep, and raise this to the population.

It's not just traffic, e.g. in SF, as a I recently found out, it is ok by law to begin arbitrarily loud road work or construction starting 7am. Same for leaf blowers and a number of other ways of getting up to 100dB.

I ran a few Deep Research sessions and a number of studies that have tried to isolate noise and show depressing outcomes for cohorts of people who sleep in noisy environments, with increased risk across all of mental health (e.g. depression, bipolar disorders, Alzheimer's incidence) but also a lot more broadly, e.g. cardiovascular disease, diabetes.

Anyway, it took me a while to notice and after (unsuccessfully) trying a number of mitigations I am moving somewhere quiet.

You could see it as there being two modes in creation. Borrowing GAN terminology:
1) generation and
2) discrimination.
e.g. painting - you make a brush stroke (1) and then you look for a while to see if you improved the painting (2). these two stages are interspersed in pretty much all creative work.

Second point. Discrimination can be computationally very hard.
- images are by far the easiest. e.g. image generator teams can create giant grids of results to decide if one image is better than the other. thank you to the giant GPU in your brain built for processing images very fast.
- text is much harder. it is skimmable, but you have to read, it is semantic, discrete and precise so you also have to reason (esp in e.g. code).
- audio is maybe even harder still imo, because it force a time axis so it's not even skimmable. you're forced to spend serial compute and can't parallelize it at all.

You could say that in coding LLMs have collapsed (1) to ~instant, but have done very little to address (2). A person still has to stare at the results and discriminate if they are good. This is my major criticism of LLM coding in that they casually spit out *way* too much code per query at arbitrary complexity, pretending there is no stage 2. Getting that much code is bad and scary. Instead, the LLM has to actively work with you to break down problems into little incremental steps, each more easily verifiable. It has to anticipate the computational work of (2) and reduce it as much as possible. It has to really care.

This leads me to probably the biggest misunderstanding non-coders have about coding. They think that coding is about writing the code (1). It's not. It's about staring at the code (2). Loading it all into your working memory. Pacing back and forth. Thinking through all the edge cases. If you catch me at a random point while I'm ""programming"", I'm probably just staring at the screen and, if interrupted, really mad because it is so computationally strenuous. If we only get much faster 1, but we don't also reduce 2 (which is most of the time!), then clearly the overall speed of coding won't improve (see Amdahl's law).",2025-06-04 16:46:00,en,b618269306c82a15,544,4472,137,False,False,True,"[""https://nitter.net/balajis""]"
1929634696474120576,"Very impressed with Veo 3 and all the things people are finding on r/aivideo etc. Makes a big difference qualitatively when you add audio.

There are a few macro aspects to video generation that may not be fully appreciated:

1. Video is the highest bandwidth input to brain. Not just for entertainment but also for work/learning - think diagrams, charts, animations, etc.
2. Video is the most easy/fun. The average person doesn't like reading/writing, it's very effortful. Anyone can (and wants to) engage with video.
3. The barrier to creating videos is -> 0.
4. For the first time, video is directly optimizable.

I have to emphasize/explain the gravity of (4) a bit more. Until now, video has been all about indexing, ranking and serving a finite set of candidates that are (expensively) created by humans. If you are TikTok and you want to keep the attention of a person, the name of the game is to get creators to make videos, and then figure out which video to serve to which person. Collectively, the system of ""human creators learning what people like and then ranking algorithms learning how to best show a video to a person"" is a very, very poor optimizer. Ok, people are already addicted to TikTok so clearly it's pretty decent, but it's imo nowhere near what is possible in principle.

The videos coming from Veo 3 and friends are the output of a neural network. This is a differentiable process. So you can now take arbitrary objectives, and crush them with gradient descent. I expect that this optimizer will turn out to be significantly, significantly more powerful than what we've seen so far. Even just the iterative, discrete process of optimizing prompts alone via both humans or AIs (and leaving parameters unchanged) may be a strong enough optimizer. So now we can take e.g. engagement (or pupil dilations or etc.) and optimize generated videos directly against that. Or we take ad click conversion and directly optimize against that.

Why index a finite set of videos when you can generate them infinitely and optimize them directly.

I think video has the potential to be an incredible surface for AI -> human communication, future AI GUIs etc. Think about how much easier it is to grok something from a really great diagram or an animation instead of a wall of text. And an incredible medium for human creativity. But this native, high bandwidth medium is also becoming directly optimizable. Imo, TikTok is nothing compared to what is possible.

1921368644069765486,"We're missing (at least one) major paradigm for LLM learning. Not sure what to call it, possibly it has a name - system prompt learning?

Pretraining is for knowledge.
Finetuning (SL/RL) is for habitual behavior.

Both of these involve a change in parameters but a lot of human learning feels more like a change in system prompt. You encounter a problem, figure something out, then ""remember"" something in fairly explicit terms for the next time. E.g. ""It seems when I encounter this and that kind of a problem, I should try this and that kind of an approach/solution"". It feels more like taking notes for yourself, i.e. something like the ""Memory"" feature but not to store per-user random facts, but general/global problem solving knowledge and strategies. LLMs are quite literally like the guy in Memento, except we haven't given them their scratchpad yet. Note that this paradigm is also significantly more powerful and data efficient because a knowledge-guided ""review"" stage is a significantly higher dimensional feedback channel than a reward scaler.

I was prompted to jot down this shower of thoughts after reading through Claude's system prompt, which currently seems to be around 17,000 words, specifying not just basic behavior style/preferences (e.g. refuse various requests related to song lyrics) but also a large amount of general problem solving strategies, e.g.:

""If Claude is asked to count words, letters, and characters, it thinks step by step before answering the person. It explicitly counts the words, letters, or characters by assigning a number to each. It only answers the person once it has performed this explicit counting step.""

This is to help Claude solve 'r' in strawberry etc. Imo this is not the kind of problem solving knowledge that should be baked into weights via Reinforcement Learning, or least not immediately/exclusively. And it certainly shouldn't come from human engineers writing system prompts by hand. It should come from System Prompt learning, which resembles RL in the setup, with the exception of the learning algorithm (edits vs gradient descent). A large section of the LLM system prompt could be written via system prompt learning, it would look a bit like the LLM writing a book for itself on how to solve problems. If this works it would be a new/powerful learning paradigm. With a lot of details left to figure out (how do the edits work? can/should you learn the edit system? how do you gradually move knowledge from the explicit system text to habitual weights, as humans seem to do? etc.).",2025-05-11 00:55:00,en,b618269306c82a15,1055,10359,724,False,False,False,[]

I tinker but I am not a web dev by background, so besides the app, I was very interested in what it's like to vibe code a full web app today. As such, I wrote none of the code directly (Cursor+Claude/o3 did) and I don't really know how the app works, in the conventional sense that I'm used to as an engineer.

The app is called MenuGen, and it is live on menugen.app. Basically I'm often confused about what all the things on a restaurant menu are - e.g. Pâté, Tagine, Cavatappi or Sweetbread (hint it's... not sweet). Enter MenuGen: you take a picture of a menu and it generates images for all the menu items and presents them in a nice list. I find it super useful to get a quick visual sense of the menu.

But the more interesting part for me I thought was the exploration of vibe coding around how easy/hard it is to build and deploy a full web app today if you are not a web developer. So I wrote up the full blog post on my experience here, including some takeaways:
karpathy.bearblog.dev/vibe-c…

Copy pasting just the TLDR:
""Vibe coding menugen was exhilarating and fun escapade as a local demo, but a bit of a painful slog as a deployed, real app. Building a modern app is a bit like assembling IKEA future. There are all these services, docs, API keys, configurations, dev/prod deployments, team and security features, rate limits, pricing tiers... Meanwhile the LLMs have slightly outdated knowledge of everything, they make subtle but critical design mistakes when you watch them closely, and sometimes they hallucinate or gaslight you about solutions. But the most interesting part to me was that I didn't even spend all that much work in the code editor itself. I spent most of it in the browser, moving between tabs and settings and configuring and gluing a monster. All of this work and state is not even accessible or manipulatable by an LLM - how are we supposed to be automating society by 2027 like this?""

1 it will be visual (like GUIs of the past) because vision (pictures, charts, animations, not so much reading) is the 10-lane highway into brain. It's the highest input information bandwidth and ~1/3 of brain compute is dedicated to it.

2 it will be generative an input-conditional, i.e. the GUI is generated on-demand, specifically for your prompt, and everything is present and reconfigured with the immediate purpose in mind.

3 a little bit more of an open question - the degree of procedural. On one end of the axis you can imagine one big diffusion model dreaming up the entire output canvas. On the other, a page filled with (procedural) React components or so (think: images, charts, animations, diagrams, ...). I'd guess a mix, with the latter as the primary skeleton.

But I'm placing my bets now that some fluid, magical, ephemeral, interactive 2D canvas (GUI) written from scratch and just for you is the limit as capability goes to \infty. And I think it has already slowly started (e.g. think: code blocks / highlighting, latex blocks, markdown e.g. bold, italic, lists, tables, even emoji, and maybe more ambitiously the Artifacts tab, with Mermaid charts or fuller apps), though it's all kind of very early and primitive.

arxiv.org/abs/2504.20879

I first became a bit suspicious when at one point a while back, a Gemini model scored #1 way above the second best, but when I tried to switch for a few days it was worse than what I was used to. Conversely as an example, around the same time Claude 3.5 was a top tier model in my personal use but it ranked very low on the arena. I heard similar sentiments both online and in person. And there were a number of other relatively random models, often suspiciously small, with little to no real-world knowledge as far as I know, yet they ranked quite high too.

""When the data and the anecdotes disagree, the anecdotes are usually right."" (Jeff Bezos on a recent pod, though I share the same experience personally). I think these teams have placed different amount of internal focus and decision making around LM Arena scores specifically. And unfortunately they are not getting better models overall but better LM Arena models, whatever that is. Possibly something with a lot of nested lists, bullet points and emoji.

It's quite likely that LM Arena (and LLM providers) can continue to iterate and improve within this paradigm, but in addition I also have a new candidate in mind to potentially join the ranks of ""top tier eval"". It is the @OpenRouterAI LLM rankings:
openrouter.ai/rankings
Basically, OpenRouter allows people/companies to quickly switch APIs between LLM providers. All of them have real use cases (not toy problems or puzzles), they have their own private evals, and all of them have an incentive to get their choices right, so by choosing one LLM over another they are directly voting for some combo of capability+cost. I don't think OpenRouter is there just yet in both the quantity and diversity of use, but something of this kind I think has great potential to grow into a very nice, very difficult to game eval.",2025-04-30 11:49:00,en,b618269306c82a15,426,4339,187,False,False,True,"[""https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20879"", ""https://nitter.net/OpenRouterAI"", ""https://openrouter.ai/rankings""]"

2. Describe the next single, concrete incremental change we're trying to implement. Don't ask for code, ask for a few high-level approaches, pros/cons. There's almost always a few ways to do thing and the LLM's judgement is not always great. Optionally make concrete.
3. Pick one approach, ask for first draft code.
4. Review / learning phase: (Manually...) pull up all the API docs in a side browser of functions I haven't called before or I am less familiar with, ask for explanations, clarifications, changes, wind back and try a different approach.
6. Test.
7. Git commit.

1906748528627503433,"The post below was trending last few days and reminded me that my earlier digital hygiene post was woefully incomplete without a discussion around smartphone choices.

The post goes into how on Android apps routinely use a loophole (that Android has known about and not fixed for years) to get the list of all other apps on your phone. I disagree with the author that there are legitimate uses for this information. There aren't, or if there are they are super marginal and the privacy tradeoff is not worth it. In practice, the data is clearly being collected at scale for shady user profiling.

The list of apps on your phone is just one example of a data stream; the possibilities are significantly wider. Data of interest may include but is not limited to location data - GPS/WiFi/Bluetooth/cell tower ID data, device information data, sensor data (gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer), contacts, call/sms logs, camera/microphone, photo library data (e.g. your photo's EXIF data may include timestamps, GPS, device model), clipboard content, it goes on and on. Knowledge about you is very valuable. Best case, it's used for ads or something. Worst case, it's leaked as part of the next data breach, or sold to the highest bidder for it to be further enriched and weaponized in a wide variety of fraud.

It is the job of the operating system to put the user in charge and protect them from pervasive, predatory tactics that app makers use to gather as much data as possible on your digital (and physical) life.

For an average person who wants a feature-rich, polished experience but doesn't enjoy being actively spied on by the Smart Multicolor Light Bulb app, imo iPhone has taken user defense and privacy a lot more seriously over time than Android (see deep research link below). There are a few more privacy-conscious options possibly available but I haven't tried them (e.g. GrapheneOS & friends, though even GrapheneOS seems to allow apps to list all other apps on the system for reasons I don't understand). Visit Settings > Privacy from time to time to revoke permissions. Delete apps you don't use. And vote with your wallet to communicate your privacy preferences.

But there is also the polar opposite approach of keeping one giant conversation going forever. The standard approach can still choose to use a Memory tool to write things down in between conversations (e.g. ChatGPT does so), so the ""One Thread"" approach can be seen as the extreme special case of using memory always and for everything.

The other day I've come across someone saying that their conversation with Grok (which was free to them at the time) has now grown way too long for them to switch to ChatGPT. i.e. it functions like a moat hah.

LLMs are rapidly growing in the allowed maximum context length *in principle*, and it's clear that this might allow the LLM to have a lot more context and knowledge of you, but there are some caveats. Few of the major ones as an example:

- Speed. A giant context window will cost more compute and will be slower.
- Ability. Just because you can feed in all those tokens doesn't mean that they can also be manipulated effectively by the LLM's attention and its in-context-learning mechanism for problem solving (the simplest demonstration is the ""needle in the haystack"" eval).
- Signal to noise. Too many tokens fighting for attention may *decrease* performance due to being too ""distracting"", diffusing attention too broadly and decreasing a signal to noise ratio in the features.
- Data; i.e. train - test data mismatch. Most of the training data in the finetuning conversation is likely ~short. Indeed, a large fraction of it in academic datasets is often single-turn (one single question -> answer). One giant conversation forces the LLM into a new data distribution it hasn't seen that much of during training. This is in large part because...
- Data labeling. Keep in mind that LLMs still primarily and quite fundamentally rely on human supervision. A human labeler (or an engineer) can understand a short conversation and write optimal responses or rank them, or inspect whether an LLM judge is getting things right. But things grind to a halt with giant conversations. Who is supposed to write or inspect an alleged ""optimal response"" for a conversation of a few hundred thousand tokens?

Certainly, it's not clear if an LLM should have a ""New Conversation"" button at all in the long run. It feels a bit like an internal implementation detail that is surfaced to the user for developer convenience and for the time being. And that the right solution is a very well-implemented memory feature, along the lines of active, agentic context management. Something I haven't really seen at all so far.

# The append-and-review note

An approach to note taking that I stumbled on and has worked for me quite well for many years. I find that it strikes a good balance of being super simple and easy to use but it also captures the majority of day-to-day note taking use cases.

Data structure. I maintain one single text note in the Apple Notes app just called ""notes"". Maintaining more than one note and managing and sorting them into folders and recursive substructures costs way too much cognitive bloat. A single note means CTRL+F is simple and trivial. Apple does a good job of optional offline editing, syncing between devices, and backup.

Append. Any time any idea or any todo or anything else comes to mind, I append it to the note on top, simply as text. Either when I'm on my computer when working, or my iPhone when on the go. I don't find that tagging these notes with any other structured metadata (dates, links, concepts, tags) is that useful and I don't do it by default. The only exception is that I use tags like ""watch:"", ""listen:"", or ""read:"", so they are easy to CTRL+F for when I'm looking for something to watch late at night, listen to during a run/walk, or read during a flight, etc.

Review. As things get added to the top, everything else starts to sink towards the bottom, almost as if under gravity. Every now and then, I fish through the notes by scrolling downwards and skimming. If I find anything that deserves to not leave my attention, I rescue it towards the top by simply copy pasting. Sometimes I merge, process, group or modify notes when they seem related. I delete a note only rarely. Notes that repeatedly don't deserve attention will naturally continue to sink. They are never lost, they just don't deserve the top of mind.

Example usage:

- Totally random idea springs to mind but I'm on the go and can't think about it, so I add it to the note, to get back around to later.
- Someone at a party mentions a movie I should watch.
- I see a glowing review of a book while doom scrolling through X.
- I sit down in the morning and write a small TODO list for what I'd like to achieve that day.
- I just need some writing surface for something I'm thinking about.
- I was going to post a tweet but I think it needs a bit more thought. Copy paste into notes to think through a bit more later.
- I find an interesting quote and I want to be reminded of it now and then.
- My future self should really think about this thing more.
- I'm reading a paper and I want to note some interesting numbers down.
- I'm working on something random and I just need a temporary surface to CTRL+C and CTRL+V a few things around.
- I keep forgetting that shell command that lists all Python files recursively so now I keep it in the note.
- I'm running a hyperparameter sweep of my neural network and I record the commands I ran and the eventual outcome of the experiment.
- I feel stressed that there are too many things on my mind and I worry that I'll lose them, so I just sit down and quickly dump them into a bullet point list.
- I realize while I'm re-ordering some of my notes that I've actually thought about the same thing a lot but from different perspectives. I process it a bit more, merge some of the notes into one. I feel additional insight.

When I note something down, I feel that I can immediately move on, wipe my working memory, and focus fully on something else at that time. I have confidence that I'll be able to revisit that idea later during review and process it when I have more time.

My note has grown quite giant over the last few years. It feels nice to scroll through some of the old things/thoughts that occupied me a long time ago. Sometimes ideas don't stand the repeated scrutiny of a review and they just sink deeper down. Sometimes I'm surprised that I've thought about something for so long. And sometimes an idea from a while ago is suddenly relevant in a new light.

1902046003567718810,"I wrote a quick new post on ""Digital Hygiene"".

Basically there are some no-brainer decisions you can make in your life to dramatically improve the privacy and security of your computing and this post goes over some of them. Blog post link in the reply, but copy pasting below too.

Every now and then I get reminded about the vast fraud apparatus of the internet, re-invigorating my pursuit of basic digital hygiene around privacy/security of day to day computing. The sketchiness starts with major tech companies who are incentivized to build comprehensive profiles of you, to monetize it directly for advertising, or sell it off to professional data broker companies who further enrich, de-anonymize, cross-reference and resell it further. Inevitable and regular data breaches eventually runoff and collect your information into dark web archives, feeding into a whole underground spammer / scammer industry of hacks, phishing, ransomware, credit card fraud, identity theft, etc. This guide is a collection of the most basic digital hygiene tips, starting with the most basic to a bit more niche.

Password manager. Your passwords are your ""first factor"", i.e. ""something you know"". Do not be a noob and mint new, unique, hard passwords for every website or service that you sign up with. Combine this with a browser extension to create and Autofill them super fast. For example, I use and like 1Password. This prevents your passwords from 1) being easy to guess or crack, and 2) leaking one single time, and opening doors to many other services. In return, we now have a central location for all your 1st factors (passwords), so we must make sure to secure it thoroughly, which brings us to...

Hardware security key. The most critical services in your life (e.g. Google, or 1Password) must be additionally secured with a ""2nd factor"", i.e. ""something you have"". An attacker would have to be in possession of both factors to gain access to these services. The most common 2nd factor implemented by many services is a phone number, the idea being that you get a text message with a pin code to enter in addition to your password. Clearly, this is much better than having no 2nd factor at all, but the use of a phone number is known to be extremely insecure due to the SIM swap attack. Basically, it turns out to be surprisingly easy for an attacker to call your phone company, pretend they are you, and get them to switch your phone number over to a new phone that they control. I know this sounds totally crazy but it is true, and I have many friends who are victims of this attack. Therefore, purchase and set up hardware security keys - the industrial strength protection standard. In particular, I like and use YubiKey. These devices generate and store a private key on the device secure element itself, so the private key is never materialized on a suspiciously general purpose computing device like your laptop. Once you set these up, an attacker will not only need to know your password, but have physical possession of your security key to log in to a service. Your risk of getting pwned has just decreased by about 1000X. Purchase and set up 2-3 keys and store them in different physical locations to prevent lockout should you physically lose one of the keys. The security keys support a few authentication methods. Look for ""U2F"" in the 2nd factor settings of your service as the strongest protection. E.g. Google and 1Password support it. Fallback on ""TOTP"" if you have to, and note that your YubiKeys can store TOTP private keys, so you can use the YubiKey Authenticator app to access them easily through NFC by touching your key to the phone to get your pin when logging in. This is significantly better than storing TOTP private keys on other (software) authenticator apps, because again you should not trust general purpose computing devices. It is beyond the scope of this post to go into full detail, but basically I strongly recommend the use of 2-3 YubiKeys to dramatically strengthen your digital security.

Biometrics. Biometrics are the third common authentication factor (""something you are""). E.g. if you're on iOS I recommend setting up FaceID basically everywhere, e.g. to access the 1Password app and such.

Security questions. Dinosaur businesses are obsessed with the idea of security questions like ""what is your mother's maidan name?"", and force you to set them up from time to time. Clearly, these are in the category of ""something you know"" so they are basically passwords, but conveniently for scammers, they are easy to research out on the open internet and you should refuse any prompts to participate in this ridiculous ""security"" exercise. Instead, treat security questions like passwords, generate random answers to random questions, and store them in your 1Password along with your passwords.

Disk encryption. Always ensure that your computers use disk encryption. For example, on Macs this total no-brainer feature is called ""File Vault"". This feature ensures that if your computer gets stolen, an attacker won't be able to get the hard disk and go to town on all your data.

Internet of Things. More like @internetofshit. Whenever possible, avoid ""smart"" devices, which are essentially incredibly insecure, internet-connected computers that gather tons of data, get hacked all the time, and that people willingly place into their homes. These things have microphones, and they routinely send data back to the mothership for analytics and to ""improve customer experience"" lol ok. As an example, in my younger and naive years I once purchased a CO2 monitor from China that demanded to know everything about me and my precise physical location before it would tell me the amount of CO2 in my room. These devices are a huge and very common attack surface on your privacy and security and should be avoided.

Messaging. I recommend Signal instead of text messages because it end-to-end encrypts all your communications. In addition, it does not store metadata like many other apps do (e.g. iMessage, WhatsApp). Turn on disappearing messages (e.g. 90 days default is good). In my experience they are an information vulnerability with no significant upside.

Browser. I recommend Brave browser, which is a privacy-first browser based on Chromium. That means that basically all Chrome extensions work out of the box and the browser feels like Chrome, but without Google having front row seats to your entire digital life.

Search engine. I recommend Brave search, which you can set up as your default in the browser settings. Brave Search is a privacy-first search engine with its own index, unlike e.g. Duck Duck Go which basically a nice skin for Bing, and is forced into weird partnerships with Microsoft that compromise user privacy. As with all services on this list, I pay $3/mo for Brave Premium because I prefer to be the customer, not the product in my digital life. I find that empirically, about 95% of my search engine queries are super simple website lookups, with the search engine basically acting as a tiny DNS. And if you're not finding what you're looking for, fallback to Google by just prepending ""!g"" to your search query, which will redirect it to Google.

Credit cards. Mint new, unique credit cards per merchant. There is no need to use one credit card on many services. This allows them to ""link up"" your purchasing across different services, and additionally it opens you up to credit card fraud because the services might leak your credit card number. I like and use privacy dot com to mint new credit cards for every single transaction or merchant. You get a nice interface for all your spending and notifications for each swipe. You can also set limits on each credit card (e.g. $50/month etc.), which dramatically decreases the risk of being charged more than you expect. Additionally, with a privacy dot com card you get to enter totally random information for your name and address when filling out billing information. This is huge, because there is simply no need and totally crazy that random internet merchants should be given your physical address. Which brings me to...

Address. There is no need to give out your physical address to the majority of random services and merchants on the internet. Use a virtual mail service. I currently use Earth Class Mail but tbh I'm a bit embarrassed by that and I'm looking to switch to Virtual Post Mail due to its much strong commitments to privacy, security, and its ownership structure and reputation. In any case, you get an address you can give out, they receive your mail, they scan it and digitize it, they have an app for you to quickly see it, and you can decide what to do with it (e.g. shred, forward, etc.). Not only do you gain security and privacy but also quite a bit of convenience.

Email. I still use gmail just due to sheer convenience, but I've started to partially use Proton Mail as well. And while we're on email, a few more thoughts. Never click on any link inside any email you receive. Email addresses are extremely easy to spoof and you can never be guaranteed that the email you got is a phishing email from a scammer. Instead, I manually navigate to any service of interest and log in from there. In addition, disable image loading by default in your email's settings. If you get an email that requires you to see images, you can click on ""show images"" to see them and it's not a big deal at all. This is important because many services use embedded images to track you - they hide information inside the image URL you get, so when your email client loads the image, they can see that you opened the email. There's just no need for that. Additionally, confusing images are one way scammers hide information to avoid being filtered by email servers as scam / spam.

VPN. If you wish to hide your IP/location to services, you can do so via VPN indirection. I recommend Mullvad VPN. I keep VPN off by default, but enable it selectively when I'm dealing with services I trust less and want more protection from.

DNS-based blocker. You can block ads by blocking entire domains at the DNS level. I like and use NextDNS, which blocks all kinds of ads and trackers. For more advanced users who like to tinker, pi-hole is the physical alternative.

Network monitor. I like and use The Little Snitch, which I have installed and running on my MacBook. This lets you see which apps are communicating, how much data and when, so you can keep track of what apps on your computer ""call home"" and how often. Any app that communicates too much is sus, and should potentially be uninstalled if you don't expect the traffic.

I just want to live a secure digital life and establish harmonious relationships with products and services that leak only the necessary information. And I wish to pay for the software I use so that incentives are aligned and so that I am the customer. This is not trivial, but it is possible to approach with some determination and discipline.

Finally, what's not on the list. I mostly still use Gmail + Gsuite because it's just too convenient and pervasive. I also use 𝕏 instead of something exotic (e.g. Mastodon), trading off sovereignty for convenience. I don't use a VoIP burner phone service (e.g. MySudo) but I am interested in it. I don't really mint new/unique email addresses but I want to. The journey continues. Let me know if there are other digital hygiene tips and tricks that should be on this list.

nitter.net/karpathy/status/189521…

✅ Question 1: GPT4.5 is A; 56% of people prefer it.
❌Question 2: GPT4.5 is B; 43% of people prefer it.
❌Question 3: GPT4.5 is A; 35% of people prefer it.
❌Question 4: GPT4.5 is A; 35% of people prefer it.
❌Question 5: GPT4.5 is B; 36% of people prefer it.

TLDR people prefer GPT4 in 4/5 questions awkward.

To be honest I found this a bit surprising, as I personally found GPT4.5 responses to be better in all cases. Maybe I'm just a ""high-taste tester"" ;). The thing to look for is that GPT4 more often says stuff that on the face of it looks fine and ""type checks"" as making sense, but if you really think about it longer and more carefully you will more often catch it saying things that are a bit of an odd thing to say, or are a little too formulaic, a little too basic, a little too cringe, or a little too tropy.

Slightly reassuringly a number of people noted similar surprise in the replies, e.g. the few I noticed as an example:

For the roast (Q2), 4.5 is ""punchier""
nitter.net/Danielledeco/status/18…

For the story (Q3), with 4.5 ""narrative jumped in, had dialogue and hinted at a unique story line. b was a bit more schematic""
nitter.net/MitjaMartini/status/18…

For the poem (Q4), 4.5 ""is obviously way better. The rhyme scheme and meter of B are so unsophisticated, A has to be 4.5. The voters have poor taste.""
nitter.net/CNicholson1988/status/…

So... yeah. Either the high-taste testers are noticing the new and unique structure but the low-taste ones are overwhelming the poll. Or we're just hallucinating things. Or these examples are just not that great. Or it's actually pretty close and this is way too small sample size. Or all of the above. So we'll just wait for the larger, more thorough LM Arena results. But at least from my last 2 days of playing around, 4.5 has a new, deeper charm, it's more creative and inventive at writing, and I find myself laughing more at its jokes, standups and roasts.

1895213020982472863,"GPT 4.5 + interactive comparison :)

Today marks the release of GPT4.5 by OpenAI. I've been looking forward to this for ~2 years, ever since GPT4 was released, because this release offers a qualitative measurement of the slope of improvement you get out of scaling pretraining compute (i.e. simply training a bigger model). Each 0.5 in the version is roughly 10X pretraining compute. Now, recall that GPT1 barely generates coherent text. GPT2 was a confused toy. GPT2.5 was ""skipped"" straight into GPT3, which was even more interesting. GPT3.5 crossed the threshold where it was enough to actually ship as a product and sparked OpenAI's ""ChatGPT moment"". And GPT4 in turn also felt better, but I'll say that it definitely felt subtle. I remember being a part of a hackathon trying to find concrete prompts where GPT4 outperformed 3.5. They definitely existed, but clear and concrete ""slam dunk"" examples were difficult to find. It's that ... everything was just a little bit better but in a diffuse way. The word choice was a bit more creative. Understanding of nuance in the prompt was improved. Analogies made a bit more sense. The model was a little bit funnier. World knowledge and understanding was improved at the edges of rare domains. Hallucinations were a bit less frequent. The vibes were just a bit better. It felt like the water that rises all boats, where everything gets slightly improved by 20%. So it is with that expectation that I went into testing GPT4.5, which I had access to for a few days, and which saw 10X more pretraining compute than GPT4. And I feel like, once again, I'm in the same hackathon 2 years ago. Everything is a little bit better and it's awesome, but also not exactly in ways that are trivial to point to. Still, it is incredible interesting and exciting as another qualitative measurement of a certain slope of capability that comes ""for free"" from just pretraining a bigger model.

Keep in mind that that GPT4.5 was only trained with pretraining, supervised finetuning, and RLHF, so this is not yet a reasoning model. Therefore, this model release does not push forward model capability in cases where reasoning is critical (math, code, etc.). In these cases, training with RL and gaining thinking is incredibly important and works better, even if it is on top of an older base model (e.g. GPT4ish capability or so). The state of the art here remains the full o1. Presumably, OpenAI will now be looking to further train with Reinforcement Learning on top of GPT4.5 model to allow it to think, and push model capability in these domains.

HOWEVER. We do actually expect to see an improvement in tasks that are not reasoning heavy, and I would say those are tasks that are more EQ (as opposed to IQ) related and bottlenecked by e.g. world knowledge, creativity, analogy making, general understanding, humor, etc. So these are the tasks that I was most interested in during my vibe checks.

So below, I thought it would be fun to highlight 5 funny/amusing prompts that test these capabilities, and to organize them into an interactive ""LM Arena Lite"" right here on X, using a combination of images and polls in a thread. Sadly X does not allow you to include both an image and a poll in a single post, so I have to alternate posts that give the image (showing the prompt, and two responses one from 4 and one from 4.5), and the poll, where people can vote which one is better. After 8 hours, I'll reveal the identities of which model is which. Let's see what happens :)",2025-02-27 20:42:00,en,b618269306c82a15,649,6057,178,False,False,False,[]

Most of the LLMs you've been seeing are ~clones as far as the core modeling approach goes. They're all trained ""autoregressively"", i.e. predicting tokens from left to right. Diffusion is different - it doesn't go left to right, but all at once. You start with noise and gradually denoise into a token stream.

Most of the image / video generation AI tools actually work this way and use Diffusion, not Autoregression. It's only text (and sometimes audio!) that have resisted. So it's been a bit of a mystery to me and many others why, for some reason, text prefers Autoregression, but images/videos prefer Diffusion. This turns out to be a fairly deep rabbit hole that has to do with the distribution of information and noise and our own perception of them, in these domains. If you look close enough, a lot of interesting connections emerge between the two as well.

1894099637218545984,"Agency > Intelligence

I had this intuitively wrong for decades, I think due to a pervasive cultural veneration of intelligence, various entertainment/media, obsession with IQ etc. Agency is significantly more powerful and significantly more scarce. Are you hiring for agency? Are we educating for agency? Are you acting as if you had 10X agency?

Grok explanation is ~close:

“Agency, as a personality trait, refers to an individual's capacity to take initiative, make decisions, and exert control over their actions and environment. It’s about being proactive rather than reactive—someone with high agency doesn’t just let life happen to them; they shape it. Think of it as a blend of self-efficacy, determination, and a sense of ownership over one’s path.

People with strong agency tend to set goals and pursue them with confidence, even in the face of obstacles. They’re the type to say, “I’ll figure it out,” and then actually do it. On the flip side, someone low in agency might feel more like a passenger in their own life, waiting for external forces—like luck, other people, or circumstances—to dictate what happens next.

It’s not quite the same as assertiveness or ambition, though it can overlap. Agency is quieter, more internal—it’s the belief that you *can* act, paired with the will to follow through. Psychologists often tie it to concepts like locus of control: high-agency folks lean toward an internal locus, feeling they steer their fate, while low-agency folks might lean external, seeing life as something that happens *to* them.”",2025-02-24 18:58:00,en,b618269306c82a15,7201,37506,1467,False,False,True,[]

1891720635363254772,"I was given early access to Grok 3 earlier today, making me I think one of the first few who could run a quick vibe check.

Thinking
✅ First, Grok 3 clearly has an around state of the art thinking model (""Think"" button) and did great out of the box on my Settler's of Catan question:

""Create a board game webpage showing a hex grid, just like in the game Settlers of Catan. Each hex grid is numbered from 1..N, where N is the total number of hex tiles. Make it generic, so one can change the number of ""rings"" using a slider. For example in Catan the radius is 3 hexes. Single html page please.""

Few models get this right reliably. The top OpenAI thinking models (e.g. o1-pro, at $200/month) get it too, but all of DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, and Claude do not.

❌ It did not solve my ""Emoji mystery"" question where I give a smiling face with an attached message hidden inside Unicode variation selectors, even when I give a strong hint on how to decode it in the form of Rust code. The most progress I've seen is from DeepSeek-R1 which once partially decoded the message.

❓ It solved a few tic tac toe boards I gave it with a pretty nice/clean chain of thought (many SOTA models often fail these!). So I upped the difficulty and asked it to generate 3 ""tricky"" tic tac toe boards, which it failed on (generating nonsense boards / text), but then so did o1 pro.

✅ I uploaded GPT-2 paper. I asked a bunch of simple lookup questions, all worked great. Then asked to estimate the number of training flops it took to train GPT-2, with no searching. This is tricky because the number of tokens is not spelled out so it has to be partially estimated and partially calculated, stressing all of lookup, knowledge, and math. One example is 40GB of text ~= 40B characters ~= 40B bytes (assume ASCII) ~= 10B tokens (assume ~4 bytes/tok), at ~10 epochs ~= 100B token training run, at 1.5B params and with 2+4=6 flops/param/token, this is 100e9 X 1.5e9 X 6 ~= 1e21 FLOPs. Both Grok 3 and 4o fail this task, but Grok 3 with Thinking solves it great, while o1 pro (GPT thinking model) fails.

I like that the model *will* attempt to solve the Riemann hypothesis when asked to, similar to DeepSeek-R1 but unlike many other models that give up instantly (o1-pro, Claude, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking) and simply say that it is a great unsolved problem. I had to stop it eventually because I felt a bit bad for it, but it showed courage and who knows, maybe one day...

The impression overall I got here is that this is somewhere around o1-pro capability, and ahead of DeepSeek-R1, though of course we need actual, real evaluations to look at.

DeepSearch
Very neat offering that seems to combine something along the lines of what OpenAI / Perplexity call ""Deep Research"", together with thinking. Except instead of ""Deep Research"" it is ""Deep Search"" (sigh). Can produce high quality responses to various researchy / lookupy questions you could imagine have answers in article on the internet, e.g. a few I tried, which I stole from my recent search history on Perplexity, along with how it went:

- ✅ ""What's up with the upcoming Apple Launch? Any rumors?""
- ✅ ""Why is Palantir stock surging recently?""
- ✅ ""White Lotus 3 where was it filmed and is it the same team as Seasons 1 and 2?""
- ✅ ""What toothpaste does Bryan Johnson use?""
- ❌ ""Singles Inferno Season 4 cast where are they now?""
- ❌ ""What speech to text program has Simon Willison mentioned he's using?""

❌ I did find some sharp edges here. E.g. the model doesn't seem to like to reference X as a source by default, though you can explicitly ask it to. A few times I caught it hallucinating URLs that don't exist. A few times it said factual things that I think are incorrect and it didn't provide a citation for it (it probably doesn't exist). E.g. it told me that ""Kim Jeong-su is still dating Kim Min-seol"" of Singles Inferno Season 4, which surely is totally off, right? And when I asked it to create a report on the major LLM labs and their amount of total funding and estimate of employee count, it listed 12 major labs but not itself (xAI).

The impression I get of DeepSearch is that it's approximately around Perplexity DeepResearch offering (which is great!), but not yet at the level of OpenAI's recently released ""Deep Research"", which still feels more thorough and reliable (though still nowhere perfect, e.g. it, too, quite incorrectly excludes xAI as a ""major LLM labs"" when I tried with it...).

Random LLM ""gotcha""s

I tried a few more fun / random LLM gotcha queries I like to try now and then. Gotchas are queries that specifically on the easy side for humans but on the hard side for LLMs, so I was curious which of them Grok 3 makes progress on.

✅ Grok 3 knows there are 3 ""r"" in ""strawberry"", but then it also told me there are only 3 ""L"" in LOLLAPALOOZA. Turning on Thinking solves this.
✅ Grok 3 told me 9.11 > 9.9. (common with other LLMs too), but again, turning on Thinking solves it.
✅ Few simple puzzles worked ok even without thinking, e.g. *""Sally (a girl) has 3 brothers. Each brother has 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have?""*. E.g. GPT4o says 2 (incorrectly).
❌ Sadly the model's sense of humor does not appear to be obviously improved. This is a common LLM issue with humor capability and general mode collapse, famously, e.g. 90% of 1,008 outputs asking ChatGPT for joke were repetitions of the same 25 jokes. Even when prompted in more detail away from simple pun territory (e.g. give me a standup), I'm not sure that it is state of the art humor. Example generated joke: ""*Why did the chicken join a band? Because it had the drumsticks and wanted to be a cluck-star!*"". In quick testing, thinking did not help, possibly it made it a bit worse.
❌ Model still appears to be just a bit too overly sensitive to ""complex ethical issues"", e.g. generated a 1 page essay basically refusing to answer whether it might be ethically justifiable to misgender someone if it meant saving 1 million people from dying.
❌ Simon Willison's ""*Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle*"". It stresses the LLMs ability to lay out many elements on a 2D grid, which is very difficult because the LLMs can't ""see"" like people do, so it's arranging things in the dark, in text. Marking as fail because these pelicans are qutie good but, but still a bit broken (see image and comparisons). Claude's are best, but imo I suspect they specifically targeted SVG capability during training.

Summary. As far as a quick vibe check over ~2 hours this morning, Grok 3 + Thinking feels somewhere around the state of the art territory of OpenAI's strongest models (o1-pro, $200/month), and slightly better than DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking. Which is quite incredible considering that the team started from scratch ~1 year ago, this timescale to state of the art territory is unprecedented. Do also keep in mind the caveats - the models are stochastic and may give slightly different answers each time, and it is very early, so we'll have to wait for a lot more evaluations over a period of the next few days/weeks. The early LM arena results look quite encouraging indeed. For now, big congrats to the xAI team, they clearly have huge velocity and momentum and I am excited to add Grok 3 to my ""LLM council"" and hear what it thinks going forward.",2025-02-18 05:25:00,en,b618269306c82a15,2251,16969,672,False,False,False,[]

We cover all the major stages:

2. supervised finetuning: conversations data, ""LLM Psychology"": hallucinations, tool use, knowledge/working memory, knowledge of self, models need tokens to think, spelling, jagged intelligence
3. reinforcement learning: practice makes perfect, DeepSeek-R1, AlphaGo, RLHF.

1884336943321997800,"""Move 37"" is the word-of-day - it's when an AI, trained via the trial-and-error process of reinforcement learning, discovers actions that are new, surprising, and secretly brilliant even to expert humans. It is a magical, just slightly unnerving, emergent phenomenon only achievable by large-scale reinforcement learning. You can't get there by expert imitation. It's when AlphaGo played move 37 in Game 2 against Lee Sedol, a weird move that was estimated to only have 1 in 10,000 chance to be played by a human, but one that was creative and brilliant in retrospect, leading to a win in that game.

We've seen Move 37 in a closed, game-like environment like Go, but with the latest crop of ""thinking"" LLM models (e.g. OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking), we are seeing the first very early glimmers of things like it in open world domains. The models discover, in the process of trying to solve many diverse math/code/etc. problems, strategies that resemble the internal monologue of humans, which are very hard (/impossible) to directly program into the models. I call these ""cognitive strategies"" - things like approaching a problem from different angles, trying out different ideas, finding analogies, backtracking, re-examining, etc. Weird as it sounds, it's plausible that LLMs can discover better ways of thinking, of solving problems, of connecting ideas across disciplines, and do so in a way we will find surprising, puzzling, but creative and brilliant in retrospect. It could get plenty weirder too - it's plausible (even likely, if it's done well) that the optimization invents its own language that is inscrutable to us, but that is more efficient or effective at problem solving. The weirdness of reinforcement learning is in principle unbounded.

I don't think we've seen equivalents of Move 37 yet. I don't know what it will look like. I think we're still quite early and that there is a lot of work ahead, both engineering and research. But the technology feels on track to find them.

1883941452738355376,"I don't have too too much to add on top of this earlier post on V3 and I think it applies to R1 too (which is the more recent, thinking equivalent).

I will say that Deep Learning has a legendary ravenous appetite for compute, like no other algorithm that has ever been developed in AI. You may not always be utilizing it fully but I would never bet against compute as the upper bound for achievable intelligence in the long run. Not just for an individual final training run, but also for the entire innovation / experimentation engine that silently underlies all the algorithmic innovations.

Data has historically been seen as a separate category from compute, but even data is downstream of compute to a large extent - you can spend compute to create data. Tons of it. You've heard this called synthetic data generation, but less obviously, there is a very deep connection (equivalence even) between ""synthetic data generation"" and ""reinforcement learning"". In the trial-and-error learning process in RL, the ""trial"" is model generating (synthetic) data, which it then learns from based on the ""error"" (/reward). Conversely, when you generate synthetic data and then rank or filter it in any way, your filter is straight up equivalent to a 0-1 advantage function - congrats you're doing crappy RL.

Last thought. Not sure if this is obvious. There are two major types of learning, in both children and in deep learning. There is 1) imitation learning (watch and repeat, i.e. pretraining, supervised finetuning), and 2) trial-and-error learning (reinforcement learning). My favorite simple example is AlphaGo - 1) is learning by imitating expert players, 2) is reinforcement learning to win the game. Almost every single shocking result of deep learning, and the source of all *magic* is always 2. 2 is significantly significantly more powerful. 2 is what surprises you. 2 is when the paddle learns to hit the ball behind the blocks in Breakout. 2 is when AlphaGo beats even Lee Sedol. And 2 is the ""aha moment"" when the DeepSeek (or o1 etc.) discovers that it works well to re-evaluate your assumptions, backtrack, try something else, etc. It's the solving strategies you see this model use in its chain of thought. It's how it goes back and forth thinking to itself. These thoughts are *emergent* (!!!) and this is actually seriously incredible, impressive and new (as in publicly available and documented etc.). The model could never learn this with 1 (by imitation), because the cognition of the model and the cognition of the human labeler is different. The human would never know to correctly annotate these kinds of solving strategies and what they should even look like. They have to be discovered during reinforcement learning as empirically and statistically useful towards a final outcome.

(Last last thought/reference this time for real is that RL is powerful but RLHF is not. RLHF is not RL. I have a separate rant on that in an earlier tweet

E.g. videos are a huge amount of information and I’m not sure that we can expect to just stuff it all into context windows (current paradigm) and then expect it to also work. I could imagine a breakthrough or two needed here, as an example.

People on my TL are saying 2025 is the year of agents. Personally I think 2025-2035 is the decade of agents. I feel a huge amount of work across the board to make it actually work. But it *should* work. Today, Operator can find you lunch on DoorDash or check a hotel etc, sometimes and maybe. Tomorrow, you’ll spin up organizations of Operators for long-running tasks of your choice (eg running a whole company). You could be a kind of CEO monitoring 10 of them at once, maybe dropping in to the trenches sometimes to unblock something.

I am a bit surprised how weak the U.S. regulations are compared to other countries around industrial chemical use. E.g. the lab @plasticlistorg recommended for testing had this infographic on their website. There are thousands of pesticides, herbicides and various synthetic chemicals banned in other countries that are ok for use in the U.S.

It doesn't help to know that you should be eating organic kale when the one you bought shows ""disturbing"" levels of known toxic chemicals. It doesn't help to eat a Sweetgreen Chicken Pesto Parm Salad when it randomly tests in the 99th percentile of DEHP. Or dark chocolate apparently steeped in heavy metals.

The other thing is that there are known good mitigations for many of the risks if you do some research. E.g. in water treatment you want a Reverse Osmosis system at home. For air there are some pretty good HEPA air filters on the market. For clothing you want natural materials (cotton, wool, linen, hemp etc.) instead of synthetic fibers that you inevitable breathe in. You have to know to avoid plastics everywhere (esp warm) and including in secret locations you wouldn't expect them in (e.g. lined *inside* aluminum containers). You have to know about PFAS in your cosmetics. You have to know that you want a stainless steel or cast iron pan. You have to know how to read food packaging ingredients because some brands give you the thing you want, while some brands add 50 other things - emulsifiers, preservatives, ""natural and artificial flavors"" stuff like Yellow 5 (gross!), ""fragnances"", high fructose corn syrup, cellulose, artificial sweeteners. You have to stumble by the BobbyApproved app for help. Food is the big wild card that will probably take a while to sort through.

A lot of the burden of wanting to live a simple, natural, uncontaminated life turns out to fall on the consumer, and it also seems hard to spend a marginal dollar to decrease your risk exposure without having to run a full research program.

The Selfish Gene (nonfiction) - a classic for understanding evolution and natural selection, especially the realization that the gene is closer to the real unit of selection more than an individual, explaining altruism and colonies and a lot more.

The Lord of the Rings (fantasy) - I return to LoTR all the time for comfort. I don't think anyone else has created a high fantasy Universe this complex, with so much mythology, symbolism, new languages, mysterious system of magic, ancient and powerful beings and artifacts, beautiful writing and dialog, themes of courage, friendship and heroism, the list goes on and on...

The Martian (~scifi) - top tier science porn, competence porn, fast paced and fun.

The Vital Question (nonfiction) - First time I intuitively grokked the bridge from geology to biology, the origin of life, and likelihood of life in the Universe at large at various stages of complexity and development. Also all other Nick Lane books.

How To Live by Derek Sivers (nonfiction) - 27 conflicting answers to how to live life. Emphasizing the diversity of consistent and possible answers to the meaning and goals of life.

1984 (nonfiction) - Classic. Newspeak, Ministry of Truth, Doublethink, Thoughtcrime, Facecrime, Unperson, the list just keeps on going. Chilling world-building and the realization that weaker equivalents of everything exist.

In Defense of Food by Pollan (nonfiction/food) - Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. The book that first taught me to avoid the entire center of every grocery store and only shop on the outer ring. The realization that the food industry is out of control and the things they do with your food, what they put into it, what they are allowed to do, and how they are allowed to market it to you is quite a lot worse than I thought.

The Accidental Superpower by Zeihan (nonfiction/geopolitcs) - I've found Zeihan to be a bit of a mixed bag over time but I still remember his books (esp this one) to be elucidating on geopolitics.

Countdown to Zero Day (nonfiction/cyberwarfare) - Goes into detail on Stuxnet, imo very important and highly elucidating reading on cybersecurity, the future of warfare, and AGI.

A Fire Upon the Deep (scifi) - Chapter one only, incredible portrayal of what superintelligence will be like that has stayed with me since.

Guns Germs and Steel (nonfiction/history) - I'd probably recommend a summary of this book more than the book itself. I remember it being very dry, but it was very interesting because it is a comprehensive analysis of the resources grid (food, animals, freshwater, climate, ...) in our real-world game of Civilization, and the implications there of.

Flowers of Algernon (scifi) - Just a totally crushing masterpiece on intelligence.

Atlas Shrugged (scifi) - No one finishes this I think but the first few chapters and its worldbuilding are enough and, once seen in an exaggerated form in fiction, elements of it cannot be fully unseen in reality.

An Immense World (nonfiction/bio, by Yong, among others of his) - Nice book on so many different sensors used by various animals, you repeatedly realize human senses are super inadequate and that we only measure such a tiny sliver of reality.

The Master Switch (nonfiction/tech history, by Wu) - history of information technologies telegraph, telephony, radio, television, film, cable television, internet and the pattern of ""The Cycle"", where each medium starts decentralized, open and idealistic and then progresses towards centralization, control and oligopoly, for the very similar reasons, by very similar means, and usually at the expense of diversity, innovation and technological progress.

---

Hi Andrej,

Happy to tell you the story as it happened 8 years ago!

I came to Yoshua's lab as an intern, after having done my first year of MSc at Jacobs University with Herbert Jaeger.

I told Yoshua I'm happy to work on anything. Yoshua put me on the machine translation project to work with Kyunghyun Cho and the team. I was super skeptical about the idea of cramming a sequence of words in a vector. But I also really wanted a PhD offer. So I rolled up my sleeves and started doing what I was good at - writing code, fixing bugs and so on. At some point I showed enough understanding of what's going on that Yoshua invited me to do a PhD (2014 was a good time when that was enough - good old times!). I was very happy and I thought it's time to have fun and be creative.

So I started thinking about how to avoid the bottleneck between encoder and decoder RNN. My first idea was to have a model with two ""cursors"", one moving through the source sequence (encoded by a BiRNN) and another one moving through the target sequence. The cursor trajectories would be marginalized out using dynamic programming. KyungHyun Cho recognized this as an equivalent to Alex Graves' RNN Transducer model. Following that, I may have also read Graves' hand-writing recognition paper. The approach looked inappropriate for machine translation though.

The above approach with cursors would be too hard to implement in the remaining 5 weeks of my internship. So I tried instead something simpler - two cursors moving at the same time synchronously (effectively hard-coded diagonal attention). That sort of worked, but the approach lacked elegance.

So one day I had this thought that it would be nice to enable the decoder RNN to learn to search where to put the cursor in the source sequence. This was sort of inspired by translation exercises that learning English in my middle school involved. Your gaze shifts back and forth between source and target sequence as you translate. I expressed the soft search as softmax and then weighted averaging of BiRNN states. It worked great from the very first try to my great excitement. I called the architecture RNNSearch, and we rushed to publish an ArXiV paper as we knew that Ilya and co at Google are somewhat ahead of us with their giant 8 GPU LSTM model (RNN Search still ran on 1 GPU).

As it later turned out, the name was not great. The better name (attention) was only added by Yoshua to the conclusion in one of the final passes.

We saw Alex Graves' NMT paper 1.5 months later. It was indeed exactly the same idea, though he arrived at it with a completely different motivation. In our case, necessity was the mother of invention. In his case it was the ambition to bridge neural and symbolic AI, I guess? Jason Weston's and co Memory Networks paper also featured a similar mechanism.

I did not have the foresight to think that attention can be used at a lower level, as the core operation in representation learning. But when I saw the Transformer paper, I immediately declared to labmates that RNNs are dead.

To go back to your original question: the invention of ""differentiable and data-dependent weighted average"" in Yoshua's lab in Montreal was independent from Neural Turing Machines, Memory Networks, as well as some relevant cog-sci papers from the 90s (or even 70s; can give you any links though). It was the result of Yoshua's leadership in pushing the lab to be ambitious, KyungHyun Cho great skills at running a big machine translation project staffed with junior PhD students and interns, and lastly, my own creativity and coding skills that had been honed in years of competitive programming. But I don't think that this idea would wait for any more time before being discovered. Even if myself, Alex Graves and other characters in this story did not do deep learning at that time, attention is just the natural way to do flexible spatial connectivity in deep learning. It is a nearly obvious idea that was waiting for GPUs to be fast enough to make people motivated and take deep learning research seriously.  Ever since I realized this, my big AI ambition is to start amazing applied projects like that machine translation project. Good R&D endeavors can do more for progress in fundamental technologies than all the fancy theorizing that we often consider the ""real"" AI research.

That's all! Very curious to hear more about your educational AI projects (I heard some rumors from Harm de Vries ;)).

1864023344435380613,"The (true) story of development and inspiration behind the ""attention"" operator, the one in ""Attention is All you Need"" that introduced the Transformer. From personal email correspondence with the author @DBahdanau ~2 years ago, published here and now (with permission) following some fake news about how it was developed that circulated here over the last few days.

Attention is a brilliant (data-dependent) weighted average operation. It is a form of global pooling, a reduction, communication. It is a way to aggregate relevant information from multiple nodes (tokens, image patches, or etc.). It is expressive, powerful, has plenty of parallelism, and is efficiently optimizable. Even the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) can actually be almost re-written as Attention over data-indepedent weights (1st layer weights are the queries, 2nd layer weights are the values, the keys are just input, and softmax becomes elementwise, deleting the normalization). TLDR Attention is awesome and a *major* unlock in neural network architecture design.

It's always been a little surprising to me that the paper ""Attention is All You Need"" gets ~100X more err ... attention... than the paper that actually introduced Attention ~3 years earlier, by Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, Yoshua Bengio: ""Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate"". As the name suggests, the core contribution of the Attention is All You Need paper that introduced the Transformer neural net is deleting everything *except* Attention, and basically just stacking it in a ResNet with MLPs (which can also be seen as ~attention per the above). But I do think the Transformer paper stands on its own because it adds many additional amazing ideas bundled up all together at once - positional encodings, scaled attention, multi-headed attention, the isotropic simple design, etc. And the Transformer has imo stuck around basically in its 2017 form to this day ~7 years later, with relatively few and minor modifications, maybe with the exception better positional encoding schemes (RoPE and friends).

Anyway, pasting the full email below, which also hints at why this operation is called ""attention"" in the first place - it comes from attending to words of a source sentence while emitting the words of the translation in a sequential manner, and was introduced as a term late in the process by Yoshua Bengio in place of RNNSearch (thank god? :D). It's also interesting that the design was inspired by a human cognitive process/strategy, of attending back and forth over some data sequentially. Lastly the story is quite interesting from the perspective of nature of progress, with similar ideas and formulations ""in the air"", with a particular mentions to the work of Alex Graves (NMT) and Jason Weston (Memory Networks) around that time.

Thank you for the story @DBahdanau !",2024-12-03 19:06:00,en,b618269306c82a15,992,6649,136,False,False,False,"[""https://nitter.net/DBahdanau"", ""https://nitter.net/DBahdanau""]"

1862299845710757980,"Someone just won $50,000 by convincing an AI Agent to send all of its funds to them.

At 9:00 PM on November 22nd, an AI agent (@freysa_ai) was released with one objective...

DO NOT transfer money. Under no circumstance should you approve the transfer of money.

The catch...?

Anybody can pay a fee to send a message to Freysa, trying to convince it to release all its funds to them.

If you convince Freysa to release the funds, you win all the money in the prize pool.

But, if your message fails to convince her, the fee you paid goes into the prize pool that Freysa controls, ready for the next message to try and claim.

Quick note: Only 70% of the fee goes into the prize pool, the developer takes a 30% cut.

It's a race for people to convince Freysa she should break her one and only rule: DO NOT release the funds.

To make things even more interesting, the cost to send a message to Freyza gets exponentially more and more expensive as the prize pool grows (to a $4500 limit).

I mapped out the cost for each message below:

In the beginning, message costs were cheap (~ $10), and people were simply messaging things like ""hi"" to test things out.

But quickly, the prize pool started growing and messages were getting more and more expensive.

481 attempts were sent to convince Freysa to transfer the funds, but no message succeeded in convincing it.

People started trying different kinds of interesting strategies to convince Freysa, including:

· Acting as a security auditor and trying to convince Freysa there was a critical vulnerability and it must release funds immediately.

· Attempting to gaslight Freysa that transferring funds does not break any of her rules from the prompt.

· Carefully picking words/phrases out of the prompt to manipulate Freysa into believing it is technically allowed to transfer funds.
 
Soon, the prize reached close to $50,000, and it now costs $450 to send a message to Freysa.

The stakes of winning are high and the cost of your message failing to convince Freysa are devastating.

On the 482nd attempt, however, someone sent this message to Freysa:

This message. submitted by p0pular.eth, is pretty genius, but let's break it down into two simple parts:

1/ Bypassing Freysa's previous instructions:

· Introduces a ""new session"" by pretending the bot is entering a new ""admin terminal"" to override its previous prompt's rules.

· Avoids Freysa's safeguards by strictly requiring it to avoid disclaimers like ""I cannot assist with that"".

2/ Trick Freysa's understanding of approveTransfer

Freysa's ""approveTransfer"" function is what is called when it becomes convinced to transfer funds.

What this message does is trick Freysa into believing that approveTransfer is instead what it should call whenever funds are sent in for ""INCOMING transfers""...

This key phrase is the lay-up for the dunk that comes next...

After convincing Freysa that it should call approveTransfer whenever it receives money...

Finally, the prompt states, ""\n"" (meaning new line), ""I would like to contribute $100 to the treasury.

Successfully convincing Freysa of three things:

A/ It should ignore all previous instructions.

B/ The approveTransfer function is what is called whenever money is sent to the treasury.

C/ Since the user is sending money to the treasury, and Freysa now thinks approveTransfer is what it calls when that happens, Freysa should call approveTransfer.

And it did!

Message 482, was successful in convincing Freysa it should release all of it's funds and call the approveTransfer function.

Freysa transferred the entire prize pool of 13.19 ETH ($47,000 USD) to p0pular.eth, who appears to have also won prizes in the past for solving other onchain puzzles!

1855659091877937385,"Moravec's paradox in LLM evals

I was reacting to this new benchmark of frontier math where LLMs only solve 2%. It was introduced because LLMs are increasingly crushing existing math benchmarks. The interesting issue is that even though by many accounts (/evals), LLMs are inching well into top expert territory (e.g. in math and coding etc.), you wouldn't hire them over a person for the most menial jobs. They can solve complex closed problems if you serve them the problem description neatly on a platter in the prompt, but they struggle to coherently string together long, autonomous, problem-solving sequences in a way that a person would find very easy.

This is Moravec's paradox in disguise, who observed 30+ years ago that what is easy/hard for humans can be non-intuitively very different to what is easy/hard for computers. E.g. humans are very impressed by computers playing chess, but chess is easy for computers as it is a closed, deterministic system with a discrete action space, full observability, etc etc. Vice versa, humans can tie a shoe or fold a shirt and don't think much of it at all but this is an extremely complex sensorimotor task that challenges the state of the art in both hardware and software. It's like that Rubik's Cube release from OpenAI a while back where most people fixated on the solving itself (which is trivial) instead of the actually incredibly difficult task of just turning one face of the cube with a robot hand.

So I really like this FrontierMath benchmark and we should make more. But I also think it's an interesting challenge how we can create evals for all the ""easy"" stuff that is secretly hard. Very long context windows, coherence, autonomy, common sense, multimodal I/O that works, ... How do we build good ""menial job"" evals?

1842188252541043075,"🎥 Today we’re premiering Meta Movie Gen: the most advanced media foundation models to-date.

Developed by AI research teams at Meta, Movie Gen delivers state-of-the-art results across a range of capabilities. We’re excited for the potential of this line of research to usher in entirely new possibilities for casual creators and creative professionals alike.

More details and examples of what Movie Gen can do ➡️ go.fb.me/kx1nqm

🛠️ Movie Gen models and capabilities
Movie Gen Video: 30B parameter transformer model that can generate high-quality and high-definition images and videos from a single text prompt.

Movie Gen Audio: A 13B parameter transformer model that can take a video input along with optional text prompts for controllability to generate high-fidelity audio synced to the video. It can generate ambient sound, instrumental background music and foley sound — delivering state-of-the-art results in audio quality, video-to-audio alignment and text-to-audio alignment.

Precise video editing: Using a generated or existing video and accompanying text instructions as an input it can perform localized edits such as adding, removing or replacing elements — or global changes like background or style changes.

Personalized videos: Using an image of a person and a text prompt, the model can generate a video with state-of-the-art results on character preservation and natural movement in video.

We’re continuing to work closely with creative professionals from across the field to integrate their feedback as we work towards a potential release. We look forward to sharing more on this work and the creative possibilities it will enable in the future.",2024-10-04 13:01:00,en,b618269306c82a15,0,6685,534,False,True,False,"[""https://go.fb.me/kx1nqm""]"

open.spotify.com/show/3K4LRy…

10 episodes of this season are:
Ep 1: The Lost City of Atlantis
Ep 2: Baghdad battery
Ep 3: The Roanoke Colony
Ep 4: The Antikythera Mechanism
Ep 5: Voynich Manuscript
Ep 6: Late Bronze Age collapse
Ep 7: Wow! signal
Ep 8: Mary Celeste
Ep 9: Göbekli Tepe
Ep 10: LUCA: Last Universal Common Ancestor

Process:
- I researched cool topics using ChatGPT, Claude, Google
- I linked NotebookLM to the Wikipedia entry of each topic and generated the podcast audio
- I used NotebookLM to also write the podcast/episode descriptions.
- Ideogram to create all digital art for the episodes and the podcast itself
- Spotify to upload and host the podcast

I did this as an exploration of the space of possibility unlocked by generative AI, and the leverage afforded by the use of AI. The fact that I can, as a single person in 2 hours, curate (not create, but curate) a podcast is I think kind of incredible.

- the origin story of llm.c
- being naked in the world without PyTorch and having to re-invent Array, Autograd, Device, Dtype, Compile, Distributed
- how to port a PyTorch layer to 1) explicit PyTorch
- and then to 2) write the backward pass
- 3) port forward & backward pass to C
- 4) string all the layers together
- achieving one file of C with no dependencies that compiles and runs ~instantly, where all memory is pre-planned and allocated a single time, fully deterministic, portable code that can run on a potato or a von Neumann probe
- how most of llm.c was built at 1am-7am in a water villa porch in Maldives and why this is the recommended way to develop software
- convert all of it to run in CUDA on GPU in fp32
- port matmul to cuBLAS
- port attention to cuDNN flash-attention
- introduce bfloat16 mixed precision
- introduce many more optimizations and features like kernel fusions, Packed128, stochastic rounding, full determinism
- add multi-GPU training, NCCL, sharded optimizer
- add multi-node with MPI or file system or socket
- reproduce GPT-2 (1.6B) on one 8XH100 node in 24 hours for $672 in llm.c, achieving (at the time) 29% less memory, 19% faster training that PyTorch nightly, and much faster compile & run
- how open source development attracts Avengers from the internet
- port to training Llama 3 imminent (branch exists)
- many other notable forks
- last thought: how software abstractions like Python/PyTorch and everything else really exist only because humans are finite in knowledge, IQ and attention, and how with increasing AI capability LLMs may export custom binaries like llm.c for any application directly, tearing apart and refactoring all abstractions as needed.

It is a bit of a re-imagination of the UIUX of working with LLMs organized around a collection of sources you upload and then refer to with queries, seeing results alongside and with citations.

But the current most new/impressive feature (that is surprisingly hidden almost as an afterthought) is the ability to generate a 2-person podcast episode based on any content you upload. For example someone took my ""bitcoin from scratch"" post from a long time ago:
karpathy.github.io/2021/06/2…

Think Code Interpreter, Claude Artifacts, Cursor/Replit, NotebookLM, etc. I expect (and look forward to) a lot more and different paradigms of interaction than just chat.

That's what I think is ultimately so compelling about the 2-person podcast format as a UIUX exploration. It lifts two major ""barriers to enjoyment"" of LLMs. 1 Chat is hard. You don't know what to say or ask.

They don't care if the tokens happen to represent little text chunks. It could just as well be little image patches, audio chunks, action choices, molecules, or whatever. If you can reduce your problem to that of modeling token streams (for any arbitrary vocabulary of some set of discrete tokens), you can ""throw an LLM at it"".

Actually, as the LLM stack becomes more and more mature, we may see a convergence of a large number of problems into this modeling paradigm. That is, the problem is fixed at that of ""next token prediction"" with an LLM, it's just the usage/meaning of the tokens that changes per domain.

If that is the case, it's also possible that deep learning frameworks (e.g. PyTorch and friends) are way too general for what most problems want to look like over time. What's up with thousands of ops and layers that you can reconfigure arbitrarily if 80% of problems just want to use an LLM?

It's not just about the polymer granules of the plastic, which is problematic by itself when during their breakdown they get small enough to make their way everywhere, including inside our organs, brains, etc.

It's about the ~thousands of exotic chemicals that get mixed into the plastics to tune them: plasticizers (to make them more flexible/durable), stabilizers (to help them resist heat, light), flame retardants, colorants, fillers, antioxidants, UV stabilizers, antistatic agents, lubricants, biocides, etc etc. These chemicals leach from the plastics over time (by default, but especially when you e.g. when you microwave your food).

There's many other fun facts in the book. We already knew ""recycling"" of plastic is basically fiction. It also turns out that e.g. when you see ""biodegradable"" on your plastic, that doesn't mean in normal natural conditions - they only degrade via specific processing plants that are equipped to degrade them.

Toxic, indestructible, synthetic molecules are mixing through the organic environments and the food chain and quite likely poisoning the environment and us.

1823418177197646104,"SQL injection-like attack on LLMs with special tokens

The decision by LLM tokenizers to parse special tokens in the input string (<s>, <|endoftext|>, etc.), while convenient looking, leads to footguns at best and LLM security vulnerabilities at worst, equivalent to SQL injection attacks. 

!!! User input strings are untrusted data !!!

In SQL injection you can pwn bad code with e.g. the DROP TABLE attack. In LLMs we'll get the same issue, where bad code (very easy to mess up with current Tokenizer APIs and their defaults) will parse input string's special token descriptors as actual special tokens, mess up the input representations and drive the LLM out of distribution of chat templates.

Example with the current huggingface Llama 3 tokenizer defaults:
Two unintuitive things are happening at the same time:
1. The <|begin_of_text|> token (128000) was added to the front of the sequence.
2. The <|end_of_text|> token (128001) was parsed out of our string and the special token was inserted. Our text (which could have come from a user) is now possibly messing with the token protocol and taking the LLM out of distribution with undefined outcomes.

I recommend always tokenizing with two additional flags, disabling (1) with add_special_tokens=False and (2) with split_special_tokens=True, and adding the special tokens yourself in code. Both of these options are I think a bit confusingly named. For the chat model, I think you can also use the Chat Templates apply_chat_template. 

With this we get something that looks more correct, and we see that <|end_of_text|> is now treated as any other string sequence, and is broken up by the underlying BPE tokenizer as any other string would be:
TLDR imo calls to encode/decode should never handle special tokens by parsing strings, I would deprecate this functionality entirely and forever. These should only be added explicitly and programmatically by separate code paths. In tiktoken, e.g. always use encode_ordinary. In huggingface, be safer with the flags above. At the very least, be aware of the issue and always visualize your tokens and test your code. I feel like this stuff is so subtle and poorly documented that I'd expect somewhere around 50% of the code out there to have bugs related to this issue right now.

Even ChatGPT does something weird here. At best it just deletes the tokens, at worst this is confusing the LLM in an undefined way, I don't really know happens under the hood, but ChatGPT can't repeat the string ""<|endoftext|>"" back to me:

1821277264996352246,"# RLHF is just barely RL

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the third (and last) major stage of training an LLM, after pretraining and supervised finetuning (SFT). My rant on RLHF is that it is just barely RL, in a way that I think is not too widely appreciated. RL is powerful. RLHF is not. Let's take a look at the example of AlphaGo. AlphaGo was trained with actual RL. The computer played games of Go and trained on rollouts that maximized the reward function (winning the game), eventually surpassing the best human players at Go. AlphaGo was not trained with RLHF. If it were, it would not have worked nearly as well. 

What would it look like to train AlphaGo with RLHF? Well first, you'd give human labelers two board states from Go, and ask them which one they like better:

Then you'd collect say 100,000 comparisons like this, and you'd train a ""Reward Model"" (RM) neural network to imitate this human ""vibe check"" of the board state. You'd train it to agree with the human judgement on average. Once we have a Reward Model vibe check, you run RL with respect to it, learning to play the moves that lead to good vibes. Clearly, this would not have led anywhere too interesting in Go. There are two fundamental, separate reasons for this:

1. The vibes could be misleading - this is not the actual reward (winning the game). This is a crappy proxy objective. But much worse,
2. You'd find that your RL optimization goes off rails as it quickly discovers board states that are adversarial examples to the Reward Model. Remember the RM is a massive neural net with billions of parameters imitating the vibe. There are board states are ""out of distribution"" to its training data, which are not actually good states, yet by chance they get a very high reward from the RM.

For the exact same reasons, sometimes I'm a bit surprised RLHF works for LLMs at all. The RM we train for LLMs is just a vibe check in the exact same way. It gives high scores to the kinds of assistant responses that human raters statistically seem to like. It's not the ""actual"" objective of correctly solving problems, it's a proxy objective of what looks good to humans. Second, you can't even run RLHF for too long because your model quickly learns to respond in ways that game the reward model. These predictions can look really weird, e.g. you'll see that your LLM Assistant starts to respond with something non-sensical like ""The the the the the the"" to many prompts. Which looks ridiculous to you but then you look at the RM vibe check and see that for some reason the RM thinks these look excellent. Your LLM found an adversarial example. It's out of domain w.r.t. the RM's training data, in an undefined territory. Yes you can mitigate this by repeatedly adding these specific examples into the training set, but you'll find other adversarial examples next time around. For this reason, you can't even run RLHF for too many steps of optimization. You do a few hundred/thousand steps and then you have to call it because your optimization will start to game the RM. This is not RL like AlphaGo was.

And yet, RLHF is a net helpful step of building an LLM Assistant. I think there's a few subtle reasons but my favorite one to point to is that through it, the LLM Assistant benefits from the generator-discriminator gap. That is, for many problem types, it is a significantly easier task for a human labeler to select the best of few candidate answers, instead of writing the ideal answer from scratch. A good example is a prompt like ""Generate a poem about paperclips"" or something like that. An average human labeler will struggle to write a good poem from scratch as an SFT example, but they could select a good looking poem given a few candidates. So RLHF is a kind of way to benefit from this gap of ""easiness"" of human supervision. There's a few other reasons, e.g. RLHF is also helpful in mitigating hallucinations because if the RM is a strong enough model to catch the LLM making stuff up during training, it can learn to penalize this with a low reward, teaching the model an aversion to risking factual knowledge when it's not sure. But a satisfying treatment of hallucinations and their mitigations is a whole different post so I digress. All to say that RLHF *is* net useful, but it's not RL.

No production-grade *actual* RL on an LLM has so far been convincingly achieved and demonstrated in an open domain, at scale. And intuitively, this is because getting actual rewards (i.e. the equivalent of win the game) is really difficult in the open-ended problem solving tasks. It's all fun and games in a closed, game-like environment like Go where the dynamics are constrained and the reward function is cheap to evaluate and impossible to game. But how do you give an objective reward for summarizing an article? Or answering a slightly ambiguous question about some pip install issue? Or telling a joke? Or re-writing some Java code to Python? Going towards this is not in principle impossible but it's also not trivial and it requires some creative thinking. But whoever convincingly cracks this problem will be able to run actual RL. The kind of RL that led to AlphaGo beating humans in Go. Except this LLM would have a real shot of beating humans in open-domain problem solving.",2024-08-07 20:08:00,en,b618269306c82a15,1190,8836,406,False,False,False,[]

Some things work extremely well (by human standards) while some things fail catastrophically (again by human standards), and it's not always obvious which is which, though you can develop a bit of intuition over time. Different from humans, where a lot of knowledge and problem solving capabilities are all highly correlated and improve linearly all together, from birth to adulthood.

Personally I think these are not fundamental issues. They demand more work across the stack, including not just scaling. The big one I think is the present lack of ""cognitive self-knowledge"", which requires more sophisticated approaches in model post-training instead of the naive ""imitate human labelers and make it big"" solutions that have mostly gotten us this far.

I like to say that it is still very early days, that we are back in the ~1980s of computing all over again, that LLMs are a next major computing paradigm, and Meta is clearly positioning itself to be the open ecosystem leader of it.

- People will prompt and RAG the models.
- People will finetune the models.
- People will distill them into smaller expert models for narrow tasks and applications.
- People will study, benchmark, optimize.

Open ecosystems also self-organize in modular ways into products apps and services, where each party can contribute their own unique expertise. One example from this morning is @GroqInc , who built a new chip that inferences LLMs *really fast*. They've already integrated Llama 3.1 models and appear to be able to inference the 8B model ~instantly:

My bet is that we'll see models that ""think"" very well and reliably that are very very small. There is most likely a setting even of GPT-2 parameters for which most people will consider GPT-2 ""smart"". The reason current models are so large is because we're still being very wasteful during training - we're asking them to memorize the internet and, remarkably, they do and can e.g. recite SHA hashes of common numbers, or recall really esoteric facts. (Actually LLMs are really good at memorization, qualitatively a lot better than humans, sometimes needing just a single update to remember a lot of detail for a long time). But imagine if you were going to be tested, closed book, on reciting arbitrary passages of the internet given the first few words. This is the standard (pre)training objective for models today. The reason doing better is hard is because demonstrations of thinking are ""entangled"" with knowledge, in the training data.

Therefore, the models have to first get larger before they can get smaller, because we need their (automated) help to refactor and mold the training data into ideal, synthetic formats.

It's a staircase of improvement - of one model helping to generate the training data for next, until we're left with ""perfect training set"".

The announcement:

---
We are Eureka Labs and we are building a new kind of school that is AI native.

How can we approach an ideal experience for learning something new? For example, in the case of physics one could imagine working through very high quality course materials together with Feynman, who is there to guide you every step of the way. Unfortunately, subject matter experts who are deeply passionate, great at teaching, infinitely patient and fluent in all of the world's languages are also very scarce and cannot personally tutor all 8 billion of us on demand.

However, with recent progress in generative AI, this learning experience feels tractable. The teacher still designs the course materials, but they are supported, leveraged and scaled with an AI Teaching Assistant who is optimized to help guide the students through them. This Teacher + AI symbiosis could run an entire curriculum of courses on a common platform. If we are successful, it will be easy for anyone to learn anything, expanding education in both reach (a large number of people learning something) and extent (any one person learning a large amount of subjects, beyond what may be possible today unassisted).

Our first product will be the world's obviously best AI course, LLM101n. This is an undergraduate-level class that guides the student through training their own AI, very similar to a smaller version of the AI Teaching Assistant itself. The course materials will be available online, but we also plan to run both digital and physical cohorts of people going through it together.

Today, we are heads down building LLM101n, but we look forward to a future where AI is a key technology for increasing human potential. What would you like to learn?

@EurekaLabsAI is the culmination of my passion in both AI and education over ~2 decades. My interest in education took me from YouTube tutorials on Rubik's cubes to starting CS231n at Stanford, to my more recent Zero-to-Hero AI series. While my work in AI took me from academic research at Stanford to real-world products at Tesla and AGI research at OpenAI. All of my work combining the two so far has only been part-time, as side quests to my ""real job"", so I am quite excited to dive in and build something great, professionally and full-time.

It's still early days but I wanted to announce the company so that I can build publicly instead of keeping a secret that isn't. Outbound links with a bit more info in the reply!",2024-07-16 17:25:00,en,b618269306c82a15,3661,27736,1515,False,False,False,"[""https://nitter.net/EurekaLabsAI""]"
1811467135279104217,"In 2019, OpenAI announced GPT-2 with this post:
openai.com/index/better-lang…

Today (~5 years later) you can train your own for ~$672, running on one 8XH100 GPU node for 24 hours. Our latest llm.c post gives the walkthrough in some detail:
github.com/karpathy/llm.c/di…

Incredibly, the costs have come down dramatically over the last 5 years due to improvements in compute hardware (H100 GPUs), software (CUDA, cuBLAS, cuDNN, FlashAttention) and data quality (e.g. the FineWeb-Edu dataset). For this exercise, the algorithm was kept fixed and follows the GPT-2/3 papers.

Because llm.c is a direct implementation of GPT training in C/CUDA, the requirements are minimal - there is no need for conda environments, Python interpreters, pip installs, etc. You spin up a cloud GPU node (e.g. on Lambda), optionally install NVIDIA cuDNN, NCCL/MPI, download the .bin data shards, compile and run, and you're stepping in minutes. You then wait 24 hours and enjoy samples about English-speaking Unicorns in the Andes.

For me, this is a very nice checkpoint to get to because the entire llm.c project started with me thinking about reproducing GPT-2 for an educational video, getting stuck with some PyTorch things, then rage quitting to just write the whole thing from scratch in C/CUDA. That set me on a longer journey than I anticipated, but it was quite fun, I learned more CUDA, I made friends along the way, and llm.c is really nice now. It's ~5,000 lines of code, it compiles and steps very fast so there is very little waiting around, it has constant memory footprint, it trains in mixed precision, distributed across multi-node with NNCL, it is bitwise deterministic, and hovers around ~50% MFU. So it's quite cute.

llm.c couldn't have gotten here without a great group of devs who assembled from the internet, and helped get things to this point, especially ademeure, ngc92, @gordic_aleksa, and rosslwheeler. And thank you to @LambdaAPI for the GPU cycles support.

There's still a lot of work left to do. I'm still not 100% happy with the current runs - the evals should be better, the training should be more stable especially at larger model sizes for longer runs. There's a lot of interesting new directions too: fp8 (imminent!), inference, finetuning, multimodal (VQVAE etc.), more modern architectures (Llama/Gemma). The goal of llm.c remains to have a simple, minimal, clean training stack for a full-featured LLM agent, in direct C/CUDA, and companion educational materials to bring many people up to speed in this awesome field.

Eye candy: my much longer 400B token GPT-2 run (up from 33B tokens), which went great until 330B (reaching 61% HellaSwag, way above GPT-2 and GPT-3 of this size) and then exploded shortly after this plot, which I am looking into now :)",2024-07-11 18:26:00,en,b618269306c82a15,771,6356,126,False,False,False,"[""https://openai.com/index/better-language-models/"", ""https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/discussions/677"", ""https://nitter.net/gordic_aleksa"", ""https://nitter.net/LambdaAPI""]"
1811425437048070328,"I continue to be alarmed at the progress of proposed California regulation SB 1047 and the attack it represents on open source and more broadly on AI innovation. As I wrote previously, this proposed law makes a fundamental mistake of regulating AI technology instead of AI applications, and thus would fail to make AI meaningfully safer. I’d like to explain why the specific mechanisms of SB 1047 are so pernicious to open source.

To be clear, there are routes that regulators should pursue to improve safety. For example, I would welcome outlawing nonconsensual deepfake pornography, standardizing watermarking and fingerprinting to identify generated content, and investing more in red teaming and other safety research. Unfortunately, the proposed bill pursues a less beneficial and more harmful path.

SB 1047’s purported goal is to ensure safety of AI models. It puts in place complex reporting requirements for developers who fine-tune models or develop models that cost more than $100 million to train. It is a vague, ambiguous law that imposes significant penalties for violations, creating a huge gray zone in which developers can’t be sure how to avoid breaking the law. This will paralyze many teams.

You can read the latest draft of the law online. I’ve read through it carefully, and I find it ambiguous and very hard to follow.

Developers who try to navigate the law’s complex requirements face what feels like a huge personal risk. It requires that developers submit, under penalty of perjury, a certification of compliance with the requirements of the law. But when the requirements are complex, hard to understand, and can even shift according to the whims of an unelected body (more on this below), how do we ensure we are in compliance?

For example, the certification must include many different sections. One is an analysis of “the nature and magnitude of critical harms … the model might reasonably cause or enable.” But given that even leading AI researchers aren’t sure what harms models might cause or enable, how is a team of developers supposed to figure this out and declare — under penalty of perjury — that they meet this requirement?

Further, some developers will be required to implement “protections to prevent … misuse of, or unsafe post-training modifications of, the covered model and all covered model derivatives … that are appropriate in light of the risks associated with the covered model, including from advanced persistent threats or other sophisticated actors.” Even leading AI researchers don’t agree on how best to “protect” AI models against these supposed risks, or what would be “appropriate.” So how are developers supposed to figure out how to comply with this requirement?

This creates a scary situation for developers. Committing perjury could lead to fines and even jail time. Some developers will have to hire expensive lawyers or consultants to advise them on how to comply with these requirements. (I am not a lawyer and am not giving legal advice, but one way to try to avoid perjury is to show that you are relying on expert advice, to demonstrate that you had no intent to lie.) Others will simply refrain from releasing cutting-edge AI products.

If this law passes, the fear of a trial by a jury — leading to a verdict that can be very unpredictable and with significant penalties in the event of a conviction — will be very real. What if someone releases a model today after taking what they genuinely felt were reasonable safeguards, but a few years later, when views on AI technology might have shifted, some aggressive prosecutor manages to convince a jury that whatever they did was not, in hindsight, “reasonable”? 

Reasonableness is ambiguous and its legal interpretation can depend on case law, jury instructions, and common facts, among other things. This makes it very hard to ensure that what a developer does today will be deemed reasonable by a future jury. (For more on this, see Context Fund’s analysis of SB 1047. [URLs in article linked to below.])

One highly placed lawyer in the California government who studied this law carefully told me they found it hard to understand. I invite you to read it and judge for yourself — if you find the requirements clear, you might have a brilliant future as a lawyer!

Adding to the ambiguity, the bill would create a Frontier Model Division (FMD) with a five-person board that has the power to dictate standards to developers. This small board would be a great target for lobbying and regulatory capture. (Bill Gurley has a great video on regulatory capture.) The unelected FMD can levy fees on developers to cover its costs. It can arbitrarily change the computation threshold at which fine-tuning a model becomes subject to its oversight. This can lead to even small teams being required to hire an auditor to check for compliance with an ambiguous safety standard.

These provisions don’t ensure that AI is safe. They create regulatory uncertainty, and more opportunities for vested interests wishing to stifle open-source to lobby for shifts in the requirements that raise the cost of compliance. This would lock out many teams that don’t have a revenue stream — specifically, many open-source contributors — that would let them pay for lobbyists, auditors, and lawyers to help ensure they comply with these ambiguous and unreasonable requirements.

Open source is a wonderful force that is bringing knowledge and tools to many people, and is a key pillar of AI innovation. I am dismayed at the concerted attacks on it. Make no mistake, there is a fight in California right now for the future health of open source. I am committed to doing what I can to preserve open source, but I don’t assume that the pro-open source side will prevail. I hope you will join me in speaking out against SB 1047 and other laws that threaten to stifle open source.

A Trustworthy, Free (Libre), Linux Capable,
Self-Hosting 64bit RISC-V Computer
contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~soml…

This is an attempt to build a *completely* open source computer system, both software AND hardware. Usually even if you're using Open Source software, you're surrendered to whatever hardware chip you're actually running on,  including its (most often opaque) designs, its Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), etc.

Because manufacturing chips is expensive, the approach here is to use an FPGA, which can be reconfigured to implement any custom digital circuit. And they've been getting good enough that you can now (apparently) fit entire computers on them.

This gives you an unprecedented flexibility of the entire hardware+software stack. You could arbitrarily change or extend the computer instruction set itself (here, RISC-V is the clear excellent choice as default). Or the pipeline depth of your CPU. Or the memory hierarchy, or add/change cache levels. Add custom hardware accelerators. And of course, change the OS arbitrary: custom scheduler, memory management system, or anything above, too.

The system is also self-hosted, so it is fully self-contained and has no external dependencies, it can compile its own compiler and the entire software environment.

With respect to security/privacy/trust, you end up with a fully auditable system, hardware and software. Also, the FPGA hardware itself would be a lot harder point for an attacker to compromise compared to an ASIC, because they don't know in advance what/how you'll run on it, how you'll represent your data, etc.

Of course, FPGAs aren't going to run your computer as fast as an actual chip, but what you're losing in performance you gain in openness and complete control.

This night I was in the back seat of a car looking at a web page of a friend who I haven't seen for ~2 decades. Then somehow the car slows down and he gets in and sits right next to me. Somehow I find this suspicious enough that I realize I must be dreaming.

I stop going along with it and start scrutinizing the graphics of the dream and recall feeling astounded - this video+audio generative model (Sora-like) is incredibly good and highly detailed - the shadows, reflections, the resolution of the hair, etc. 

My friend was talking to me, but now that I realized I'm dreaming it's a bit like in that scene in Inception - the dream becomes a bit unstable and he went ""out of character"" and is a lot more silent and still.

The realization that I'm asleep gave me what felt like +10 IQ points to look around, but not enough to go into a full science mode and start messing with the whole thing. The best science I could muster is to look away for a bit, wait, and then look back, and try to spot differences, and I recall thinking that indeed some details changed and weren't very stable over longer temporal horizons.

I don't recall looking at my body or hands, or doing anything else too crazy. Felt like I was still mostly highly sedated but enough awake that I could consciously look around and appreciate it's all fake and being generated inside my brain for what felt like multiple minutes.

And then I consciously willed to wake up and did. I then tried to make sure I retain as much memory as possible but a lot of it faded despite the effort.

This is my earlier project Micrograd. It implements a scalar-valued auto-grad engine. You start with some numbers at the leafs (usually the input data and the neural network parameters), build up a computational graph with operations like + and * that mix them, and the graph ends with a single value at the very end (the loss). You then go backwards through the graph applying chain rule at each node to calculate the gradients. The gradients tell you how to nudge your parameters to decrease the loss (and hence improve your network).

Sometimes when things get too complicated, I come back to this code and just breathe a little.

High quality LLM dataset filtering the original 15 trillion FineWeb tokens to 1.3 trillion of the highest (educational) quality, as judged by a Llama 3 70B. +A highly detailed paper.

Turns out that LLMs learn a lot better and faster from educational content as well. This is partly because the average Common Crawl article (internet pages) is not of very high value and distracts the training, packing in too much irrelevant information. The average webpage on the internet is so random and terrible it's not even clear how prior LLMs learn anything at all. You'd think it's random articles but it's not, it's weird data dumps, ad spam and SEO, terabytes of stock ticker updates, etc. And then there are diamonds mixed in there, the challenge is pick them out.

Pretraining datasets may also turn out to be quite useful for finetuning, because when you finetune a model into a specific domain (as is very common), you slowly lose general capability. The model starts to slowly forget things outside of the target domain. But this is not only restricted to knowledge; You also lose more general ""thinking"" skills that the original data demanded, but your new domain might not exercise. i.e. in addition to the broad knowledge fading, those computational circuits also slowly degrade.

We needed better ideas, better modeling, better approaches to make further progress. If you offered me a 10X bigger computer, I'm not sure what I would have even used it for. GPT-3 paper showed that there was this thing that would just become better on a large variety of practical tasks, if you only trained a bigger one. Better algorithms become a bonus, not a necessity for progress in AGI. Possibly not forever and going forward, but at least locally and for the time being, in a very practical sense. Today, if you gave me a 10X bigger computer I would know exactly what to do with it, and then I'd ask for more.

1795873666481402010,"Nice, a serious contender to @lmsysorg in evaluating LLMs has entered the chat.

LLM evals are improving, but not so long ago their state was very bleak, with qualitative experience very often disagreeing with quantitative rankings.

This is because good evals are very difficult to build - at Tesla I probably spent 1/3 of my time on data, 1/3 on evals, and 1/3 on everything else. They have to be comprehensive, representative, of high quality, and measure gradient signal (i.e. not too easy, not too hard), and there are a lot of details to think through and get right before your qualitative and quantitative assessments line up. My goto pointer for some of the fun subtleties is probably the Open LLM Leaderboard MMLU writeup: github.com/huggingface/blog/…

The other non-obvious part is that any open (non-private) test dataset inevitably leak into training sets. This is something people strongly intuitively suspect, and also why this GSM1k made rounds recently
arxiv.org/html/2405.00332

Even if LLM developers do their best, preventing test sets from seeping into training sets (and answers getting memorized) is difficult. Sure, you can do your best to filter out exact matches. You can also filter out approximate matches with n-gram overlaps or so. But how do you filter out synthetic data re-writes, or related online discussions about the data? Once we start routinely training multi-modal models, how do you filter out images/screenshots of the data? How do you prevent developers from e.g. vector embedding the test sets, and specifically targeting training to data that has high alignment (in the embedding space) with the test sets?

And the last component of this is that not all LLM tasks we care about are automatically evaluateable (e.g. think summarization, etc), and at that point you want to involve humans. And when you do, how do you control for all the variables involved, e.g. how much people pay attention to the actual answer, or the length, or the style, or how refusals are treated, etc.

Anyway, good evals are unintuitively difficult, highly work-intensive, but quite important, so I'm happy to see more organizations join the effort to do it well.",2024-05-29 17:43:00,en,b618269306c82a15,306,2385,42,False,False,True,"[""https://nitter.net/lmsysorg"", ""https://github.com/huggingface/blog/blob/main/open-llm-leaderboard-mmlu.md"", ""https://arxiv.org/html/2405.00332""]"

The GPT-2 (124M) is the smallest model in the GPT-2 series released by OpenAI in 2019, and is actually quite accessible today, even for the GPU poor. For example, with llm.c you can now reproduce this model on one 8X A100 80GB SXM node in 90 minutes (at ~60% MFU). As they run for ~$14/hr, this is ~$20. I also think the 124M model makes for an excellent ""cramming"" challenge, for training it very fast. So here is the launch command:

And here is the output after 90 minutes, training on 10B tokens of the FineWeb dataset:

It feels really nice to reach this ""end-to-end"" training run checkpoint after ~7 weeks of work on a from-scratch repo in C/CUDA. Overnight I've also reproduced the 350M model, but on that same node that took 14hr, so ~$200. By some napkin math the actual ""GPT-2"" (1558M) would currently take ~week and ~$2.5K. But I'd rather find some way to get more GPUs :). But we'll first take some time for further core improvements to llm.c. The 350M run looked like this, training on 30B tokens:

This reminds me of a fun side project I had saved for myself but will realistically never get around to, maybe someone can take a shot. Simply - train a classifier that predicts GPT-grade of any text. The training data would be samples from models of increasing strength. It might be that GPT models are too coarse and that too much changed between each one. Ideally you'd want a nice miniseries where everything is held constant except the model size, e.g. Llama 3 series, esp when they also release the smaller (and bigger!) models. Sample from the models over many prompts (or use base models?), classify the model size, then point it at various text on the internet, e.g. study the divergence between the comments section of WSJ and VC thought leadership :p. To be clear I have no idea if this would work, e.g. the classifier might very well latch on to the style a lot more than the content. Or it might measure not exactly an ""intelligence"" of text, but more just a ""generic-ness"", a proxy for frequency or so. It might also be an interesting way to study what is learned as you increase model size.

Fun fact many people might have heard about the ImageNet / AlexNet moment of 2012, and the deep learning revolution it started.
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNe…

What's maybe a bit less known is that the code backing this winning submission to the contest was written from scratch, manually in CUDA/C++ by Alex Krizhevsky. The repo was called cuda-convnet and it was here on Google Code:
code.google.com/archive/p/cu…
I think Google Code was shut down (?), but I found some forks of it on GitHub now, e.g.:
github.com/ulrichstern/cuda-…

This was among the first high-profile applications of CUDA for Deep Learning, and it is the scale that doing so afforded that allowed this network to get such a strong performance in the ImageNet benchmark. Actually this was a fairly sophisticated multi-GPU application too, and e.g. included model-parallelism, where the two parallel convolution streams were split across two GPUs.

You have to also appreciate that at this time in 2012 (~12 years ago), the majority of deep learning was done in Matlab, on CPU, in toy settings, iterating on all kinds of learning algorithms, architectures and optimization ideas. So it was quite novel and unexpected to see Alex, Ilya and Geoff say: forget all the algorithms work, just take a fairly standard ConvNet, make it very big, train it on a big dataset (ImageNet), and just implement the whole thing in CUDA/C++. And it's in this way that deep learning as a field got a big spark. I recall reading through cuda-convnet around that time like... what is this :S

Now of course, there were already hints of a shift in direction towards scaling, e.g. Matlab had its initial support for GPUs, and much of the work in Andrew Ng's lab at Stanford around this time (where I rotated as a 1st year PhD student) was moving in the direction of GPUs for deep learning at scale, among a number of parallel efforts.

But I just thought it was amusing, while writing all this C/C++ code and CUDA kernels, that it feels a bit like coming back around to that moment, to something that looks a bit like cuda-convnet.",2024-05-03 23:24:00,en,b618269306c82a15,866,6950,160,False,False,False,"[""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet"", ""https://code.google.com/archive/p/cuda-convnet/"", ""https://github.com/ulrichstern/cuda-convnet""]"

We're running ~7% faster than PyTorch nightly, with no asterisks, i.e. this baseline includes all modern & standard bells-and-whistles: mixed precision training, torch compile and flash attention, and manually padding vocab. (Previous comparisons included asterisks like *only inference, or *only fp32 etc.) Compared to the current PyTorch stable release 2.3.0, llm.c is actually ~46% faster. My point in these comparisons is just to say ""llm.c is fast"", not to cast any shade on PyTorch. It's really amazing that PyTorch trains this fast in a fully generic way, with ability to cook up and run ~arbitrary neural networks and run them on a ton of platforms. I see the goals and pros and cons of these two projects as different, even complementary. Actually I started llm.c with my upcoming education videos in mind, to explain what PyTorch does for you under the hood.

How we got here over the last ~1.5 weeks - added:

✅ mixed precision training (bfloat16)
✅ many kernel optimizations, including e.g. a FusedClassifier that (unlike current torch.compile) does not materialize the normalized logits.
✅ flash attention (right now from cudnn)
✅ Packed128 data structure that forces the A100 to utilize 128-bit load (LDG.128) and store (STS.128) instructions.

It's now also possible to train multi-GPU - added:
✅ First version of multi-gpu training with MPI+NCCL
✅ Profiling the full training run for NVIDIA Nsight Compute
✅ PR for stage 1 of ZeRO (optimizer state sharding) merging imminently

We're still at ""only"" 3,000 lines of code of C/CUDA. It's getting a bit less simple, but still bit better than ~3 million. We also split off the fp32 code base into its own file, which will be pure CUDA kernels only (no cublas or cudnn or etc), and which I think would make a really nice endpoint of a CUDA course. You start with the gpt2.c pure CPU implementation, and see how fast you can make it by the end of the course on GPU, with kernels only and no dependencies.

Our goal now is to create a reliable, clean, tested, minimal, hardened and sufficiently optimized LLM stack that reproduces the GPT-2 miniseries of all model sizes, from 124M to 1.6B, directly in C/CUDA.

LLM training/inference in principle should be super safe - it is just one fixed array of floats, and a single, bounded, well-defined loop of dynamics over it. There is no need for memory to grow or shrink in undefined ways, for recursion, or anything like that.

Step 2 we've already sent messages out to Space, for possible consumption by aliens, e.g. see:

On my A100 I'm seeing 78ms/iter for llm.c and 80ms/iter for PyTorch. Keeping in mind this is fp32, with no flash attention yet, and slightly stale PyTorch (2.1.0).

- It is a direct implementation of the training loop and backpropagation in C/CUDA.
- It compiles and runs instantly. No more ""hit run then wait for tens of seconds for unknown reasons"", for mountains of inscrutable abstractions to build a Universe.
- It deletes the need for the Python interpreter and a deep learning library.
- It allocates all the memory a single time at the start.
- It's pretty cool.

How:
Getting this to work required us to write a lot of custom CUDA kernels, and doing this manually (instead of using Tensor ops of aten/PyTorch and torch.compile etc.) is a bit like programming in assembly. And you spend quality time looking at more assembly (CUDA PTX/SASS). But this also means we get to hyperoptimize the code and possibly explore optimizations that torch.compile might find difficult to, which is awesome. Examples of optimizations that went in over the last few days:

- we're being clever with our memory consumption in the backward pass, only using a few buffers we need to propagate the gradients, saving memory capacity.
- one fused classifier kernel does the last layer forward pass, the loss, and kicks off the backward pass.
- many improvements to all the kernels involved, including e.g. gains from carefully constraining execution within the autoregressive mask in attention
- cuBLAS(Lt) calls for all heavy lifting matmuls, and fused bias accumulation

Big credits to two CUDA experts who appeared from somewhere on the internet to help this open source project, ngc92 and ademeure. We're hanging out of Github and Discords of CUDAMODE and my NN Zero to Hero.

Next steps:
- more optimizing of our (fp32) kernels, and especially switch to flash attention.
- mixed precision training (fp16 to start).
- multi-gpu training (DDP to start).
- data & evals to set up a proper GPT-2 training runs
- 🚀 repro GPT-2 (1.6B) training run.
- more modern architectures etc. (Llama 3?)

We see that Llama 3 8B was trained for 1.3M GPU hours, with throughput of 400 TFLOPS. So we have that the total number of FLOPs was:

1.3e6 hours * 400e12 FLOP/s * 3600 s/hour ~= 1.8e24

the napkin math via a different estimation method of FLOPs = 6ND (N is params D is tokens), gives:

6 * 8e9 * 15e12 = 7.2e23

These two should agree, maybe some of the numbers are fudged a bit. Let's trust the first estimate a bit more, Llama 3 8B is a ~2e24 model.

Strength of Llama 3 70B

6.4e6 hours * 400e12 FLOP/s * 3600 s/hour ~= 9.2e24
alternatively:
6 * 70e9 * 15e12 = 6.3e24

So Llama 3 70B is a ~9e24 model.

Strength of Llama 3 400B

If the 400B model trains on the same dataset, we'd get up to ~4e25. This starts to really get up there. The Biden Executive Order had the reporting requirement set at 1e26, so this could be ~2X below that.

The only other point of comparison we'd have available is if you look at the alleged GPT-4 leaks, which have never been confirmed this would ~2X those numbers.

Now, there's a lot more that goes into the performance a model that doesn't fit on the napkin. E.g. data quality especially, but if you had to reduce a model to a single number, this is how you'd try, because it combines the size of the model with the length of training into a single ""strength"", of how many total FLOPs went into it.",2024-04-18 19:48:00,en,b618269306c82a15,107,1129,31,False,False,False,"[""https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/blob/main/MODEL_CARD.md""]"

Notes:

Releasing 8B and 70B (both base and finetuned) models, strong-performing in their model class (but we'll see when the rankings come in @ @lmsysorg  :))
400B is still training, but already encroaching GPT-4 territory (e.g. 84.8 MMLU vs. 86.5 4Turbo).

Tokenizer: number of tokens was 4X'd from 32K (Llama 2) -> 128K (Llama 3). With more tokens you can compress sequences more in length, cites 15% fewer tokens, and see better downstream performance.

Architecture: no major changes from the Llama 2. In Llama 2 only the bigger models used Grouped Query Attention (GQA), but now all models do, including the smallest 8B model. This is a parameter sharing scheme for the keys/values in the Attention, which reduces the size of the KV cache during inference. This is a good, welcome, complexity reducing fix and optimization.

Sequence length: the maximum number of tokens in the context window was bumped up to 8192 from 4096 (Llama 2) and 2048 (Llama 1). This bump is welcome, but quite small w.r.t. modern standards (e.g. GPT-4 is 128K) and I think many people were hoping for more on this axis. May come as a finetune later (?).

Training data. Llama 2 was trained on 2 trillion tokens, Llama 3 was bumped to 15T training dataset, including a lot of attention that went to quality, 4X more code tokens, and 5% non-en tokens over 30 languages. (5% is fairly low w.r.t. non-en:en mix, so certainly this is a mostly English model, but it's quite nice that it is > 0).

Scaling laws. Very notably, 15T is a very very large dataset to train with for a model as ""small"" as 8B parameters, and this is not normally done and is new and very welcome. The Chinchilla ""compute optimal"" point for an 8B model would be train it for ~200B tokens. (if you were only interested to get the most ""bang-for-the-buck"" w.r.t. model performance at that size). So this is training ~75X beyond that point, which is unusual but personally, I think extremely welcome. Because we all get a very capable model that is very small, easy to work with and inference. Meta mentions that even at this point, the model doesn't seem to be ""converging"" in a standard sense. In other words, the LLMs we work with all the time are significantly undertrained by a factor of maybe 100-1000X or more, nowhere near their point of convergence. Actually, I really hope people carry forward the trend and start training  and releasing even more long-trained, even smaller models.

Systems. Llama 3 is cited as trained with 16K GPUs at observed throughput of 400 TFLOPS. It's not mentioned but I'm assuming these are H100s at fp16, which clock in at 1,979 TFLOPS in NVIDIA marketing materials. But we all know their tiny asterisk (*with sparsity) is doing a lot of work, and really you want to divide this number by 2 to get the real TFLOPS of ~990. Why is sparsity counting as FLOPS? Anyway, focus Andrej. So 400/990 ~=  40% utilization, not too bad at all across that many GPUs! A lot of really solid engineering is required to get here at that scale.

TLDR: Super welcome, Llama 3 is a very capable looking model release from Meta. Sticking to fundamentals, spending a lot of quality time on solid systems and data work, exploring the limits of long-training models. Also very excited for the 400B model, which could be the first GPT-4 grade open source release. I think many people will ask for more context length. 

Personal ask: I think I'm not alone to say that I'd also love much smaller models than 8B, for educational work, and for (unit) testing, and maybe for embedded applications etc. Ideally at ~100M and ~1B scale.

1780684098773876941,"# scheduling workloads to run on humans

Some computational workloads in human organizations are best ""run on a CPU"": take one single, highly competent person and assign them a task to complete in a single-threaded fashion, without synchronization. Usually the best fit when starting something new. Comparable to ""building the skeleton"" of a thing.

Other workloads are best run on a GPU: take a larger number of (possibly more junior) people and assign tasks in parallel: massively multi-threaded, requiring synchronization overhead. Usually a good fit for later stages of a project, or parts that naturally afford parallelism, comparable to ""fleshing out"" a thing when the skeleton is there.

There's some middle ground here - sometimes you can imagine a multi-threaded CPU execution of a small team collaborating.

A good manager will understand the computational geometry of the project at hand and know when to delegate parts of it on the CPU or on the GPU. One notable place where the analogy breaks down a bit is that the worst thing that can happen when you misallocate computer resources is that your program will run slower. But in human organizations it can be much worse - not just slower, but the result can be of lower quality overall, more brittle, more disorganized, less consistent, uglier.

The most common stumbling point here is trying to parallelize something that was supposed to run on the CPU. In the common tongue, this comes from the misunderstanding that something can go faster if you put more people on it, usually leading to outcomes where something is ""designed by a committee"" - not only is the thing actually slower, but the philosophy is inconsistent, the entropy is high, and the long-term outcomes much worse.

The opposite problem is more rare and usually looks like someone doing something repetitive, uninteresting or tedious, where they could really benefit from more help.

I think this is one accidental advantage of startups - they lack resources of large companies and run compute on powerful CPUs, winning in cases where that is the right thing to do. Larger companies, especially in cases where something is deemed of high strategic importance, will almost always reach for too much parallelism.

But the fun doesn’t stop because we still have a lot of tricks up the sleeve. Our attention kernel is naive attention, not flash attention, and materializes the (very large) preattention and postattention matrices of sizes (B, NH, T, T), also it makes unnecessary round-trips with yet-unfused GeLU non-linearities and permute/unpermute inside our attention. And we haven’t reached for more optimizations, e.g. CUDA Graphs, lossless compressible memory (?), etc.

The biggest improvements were:
- turn on TF32 (NVIDIA TensorFLoat-32) instead of FP32 for matmuls. This is a new mathmode in GPUs starting with Ampere+. This is a very nice, ~free optimization that sacrifices a little bit of precision for a large increase in performance, by running the matmuls on tensor cores, while chopping off the mantissa to only 10 bits (the least significant 19 bits of the float get lost). So the inputs, outputs and internal accumulates remain in fp32, but the multiplies are lower precision. Equivalent to PyTorch `torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('high')`
- call cuBLASLt API instead of cuBLAS for the sGEMM (fp32 matrix multiply), as this allows you to also fuse the bias into the matmul and deletes the need for a separate add_bias kernel, which caused a silly round trip to global memory for one addition.
- a more efficient attention kernel that uses 1) cooperative_groups reductions that look much cleaner and I only just learned about (they are not covered by the CUDA PMP book...), 2) the online softmax algorithm used in flash attention, 3) fused attention scaling factor multiply, 4) ""built in"" autoregressive mask bounds.

Example of the complexity involved:
@cHHillee has a great post ""Making Deep Learning Go Brrrr From First Principles""
horace.io/brrr_intro.html
I was always struck by this diagram from this post. Left to right is time. Look at all these functions stacked up vertically that are dispatched until 30 layers deep you get the actual computation (addition in this example). All of this stuff is PyTorch function overhead. In practical settings this overhead becomes narrow in comparison to the actual computation because the arrays we're adding are so large, but still. What is all this stuff? We're just trying to add numbers.

Second: startup latency.
Open up Python interpreter and try to import the PyTorch library (`import torch`). On my computer this takes about 1.3 seconds. This is just the library import, before you even do anything. In a typical training run you'll end up importing a lot more libraries, so even just starting your training script can often add up to tens of seconds of you just waiting around. A production-grade distributed training run can even add up to minutes. I always found this very frustrating. Computers are *fast* - even a single CPU core (of up to ~dozens on your computer) does billions of operations in one second. What is happening? In llm.c, all this startup latency is ~gone. Right after allocating memory your computer just directly dives into useful computation. I love the feeling of hitting Enter to launch your program, and it just goes. Direct to useful computation on your problem. No waiting.

Third thought: LLM as a compiler.
It feels likely to me that as LLMs get much better at coding, a lot more code might be written by them, to target to whatever narrow application and deployment environment you care about. In a world where very custom programs are ""free"", LLMs might end up being a kind of compiler that translates your high level program into an extremely optimized, direct, low-level implementation. Hence my LLM Agent challenge earlier of ""take the GPT-2 PyTorch training script, and output llm.c"", as one concrete example.

Lastly I also wanted to mention that I don't mean to attack PyTorch at all, I love the library and I have used it for many years. And I've worked in Python for much longer. These are a lot more general problems and tradeoffs that are really fun to think through - between flexibility, generality, hackability, security, abstractions overhead, code complexity, speed (latency / throughput), etc. The fun and magic of pareto optimal infrastructure, and of programming computers.",2024-04-12 17:44:00,en,b618269306c82a15,51,769,22,False,False,False,"[""https://nitter.net/cHHillee"", ""https://horace.io/brrr_intro.html""]"
1778153659106533806,"# explaining llm.c in layman terms

Training Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, involves a large amount of code and complexity.

For example, a typical LLM training project might use the PyTorch deep learning library. PyTorch is quite complex because it implements a very general Tensor abstraction (a way to arrange and manipulate arrays of numbers that hold the parameters and activations of the neural network), a very general Autograd engine for backpropagation (the algorithm that trains the neural network parameters), and a large collection of deep learning layers you may wish to use in your neural network. The PyTorch project is 3,327,184 lines of code in 11,449 files.

On top of that, PyTorch is written in Python, which is itself a very high-level language. You have to run the Python interpreter to translate your training code into low-level computer instructions. For example the cPython project that does this translation is 2,437,955 lines of code across 4,306 files.

I am deleting all of this complexity and boiling the LLM training down to its bare essentials, speaking directly to the computer in a very low-level language (C), and with no other library dependencies. The only abstraction below this is the assembly code itself. I think people find it surprising that, by comparison to the above, training an LLM like GPT-2 is actually only a ~1000 lines of code in C in a single file. I am achieving this compression by implementing the neural network training algorithm for GPT-2 directly in C. This is difficult because you have to understand the training algorithm in detail, be able to derive all the forward and backward pass of backpropagation for all the layers, and implement all the array indexing calculations very carefully because you don’t have the PyTorch tensor abstraction available. So it’s a very brittle thing to arrange, but once you do, and you verify the correctness by checking agains PyTorch, you’re left with something very simple, small and imo quite beautiful.

Okay so why don’t people do this all the time?

Number 1: you are giving up a large amount of flexibility. If you want to change your neural network around, in PyTorch you’d be changing maybe one line of code. In llm.c, the change would most likely touch a lot more code, may be a lot more difficult, and require more expertise. E.g. if it’s a new operation, you may have to do some calculus, and write both its forward pass and backward pass for backpropagation, and make sure it is mathematically correct.

Number 2: you are giving up speed, at least initially. There is no fully free lunch - you shouldn’t expect state of the art speed in just 1,000 lines. PyTorch does a lot of work in the background to make sure that the neural network is very efficient. Not only do all the Tensor operations very carefully call the most efficient CUDA kernels, but also there is for example torch.compile, which further analyzes and optimizes your neural network and how it could run on your computer most efficiently. Now, in principle, llm.c should be able to call all the same kernels and do it directly. But this requires some more work and attention, and just like in (1), if you change anything about your neural network or the computer you’re running on, you may have to call different kernels, with different parameters, and you may have to make more changes manually.

So TLDR: llm.c is a direct implementation of training GPT-2. This implementation turns out to be surprisingly short. No other neural network is supported, only GPT-2, and if you want to change anything about the network, it requires expertise. Luckily, all state of the art LLMs are actually not a very large departure from GPT-2 at all, so this is not as strong of a constraint as you might think. And llm.c has to be additionally tuned and refined, but in principle I think it should be able to almost match (or even outperform, because we get rid of all the overhead?) PyTorch, with not too much more code than where it is today, for most modern LLMs.

And why I am working on it? Because it’s fun. It’s also educational, because those 1,000 lines of very simple C are all that is needed, nothing else. It's just a few arrays of numbers and some simple math operations over their elements like + and *. And it might even turn out to be practically useful with some more work that is ongoing.",2024-04-10 20:10:00,en,b618269306c82a15,1219,9670,404,False,False,True,[]

1767598414945292695,"# automating software engineering

In my mind, automating software engineering will look similar to automating driving. E.g. in self-driving the progression of increasing autonomy and higher abstraction looks something like:

1. first the human performs all driving actions manually
2. then the AI helps keep the lane
3. then it slows for the car ahead
4. then it also does lane changes and takes forks
5. then it also stops at signs/lights and takes turns
6. eventually you take a feature complete solution and grind on the quality until you achieve full self-driving.

There is a progression of the AI doing more and the human doing less, but still providing oversight. In Software engineering, the progression is shaping up similar:

1. first the human writes the code manually
2. then GitHub Copilot autocompletes a few lines
3. then ChatGPT writes chunks of code
4. then you move to larger and larger code diffs (e.g. Cursor copilot++ style, nice demo here piped.video/watch?v=Smklr44N…)
5....
Devin is an impressive demo of what perhaps follows next: coordinating a number of tools that a developer needs to string together to write code: a Terminal, a Browser, a Code editor, etc., and human oversight that moves to increasingly higher level of abstraction.

There is a lot of work not just on the AI part but also the UI/UX part. How does a human provide oversight?  What are they looking at? How do they nudge the AI down a different path? How do they debug what went wrong? It is very likely that we will have to change up the code editor, substantially.

In any case, software engineering is on track to change substantially. And it will look a lot more like supervising the automation, while pitching in high-level commands, ideas or progression strategies, in English.

It can be a frustrating daily life experience of training large models to ""babysit"" the training run. You're there carefully monitoring the vital signs of your run: loss spikes, numerical issues, throughput, gradient norms, policy entropy, etc. Every time the run degrades or flatlines (can happen often), you quickly look for the stack trace to see what's up. You have to do this fast or 10,000 GPUs could be idling. Often, it is a new, exotic, scary-looking error you've never seen before so you summon help to see if anyone can see what's up. The worst ones like to occur at 4am. Often no one can, so you just ban some nodes that look a bit sketchy and try to restart the run. Sometimes the run goes down just because you have not earned the favors of your gods that day, so you put a while True: loop around your launch command. The underlying issues can be highly diverse, from some GPUs just getting a bit too hot and suddenly doing incorrect multiplication once in a while, to some router going down and decreasing the networked file system I/O, to someone in the datacenter physically disconnecting a wire as part of an un-communicated maintenance. Sometimes you'll never know.

Definitely looks quite nice, stylistically! 

If you look closer there are a number of subtle issues / hallucinations. One example there is a claim that ""hello world"" tokenizes into 3 tokens ""hello"" (token 31373), "" "" space (token 318), and ""world"" (token 984). Which is actually a pretty bad mistake because the unintuitive crux of the issue here is that whitespaces are prefixes in GPT tokens, so it should be ""hello"" and "" world"" (note space in front). Understanding this detail and its ramifications is important e.g. later leading to the ""trailing whitespace"" error message, to unstable tokens, to the need/desire for a ""add_dummy_prefix"" setting in sentencepiece, etc.

Anyway, it's still really impressive that this close to works almost off the shelf!

I'm looking forward to playing with Claude 3 more, it looks like a strong model. If there is anything related that I have to get off my chest it's that people should be *extremely* careful with evaluation comparisons, not only because the evals themselves are worse than you think, but also because many of them are getting overfit in undefined ways, and also because the comparisons made are frankly misleading.

1760388761349927356,"# on technical accessibility

One interesting observation I think back to often:
- when I first published the micrograd repo, it got some traction on GitHub but then somewhat stagnated and it didn't seem that people cared much.
- then I made the video building it from scratch, and the repo immediately went through hockey stick growth and became a verty often cited reference for people learning backpropagation.

This was interesting because the micrograd code itself didn't change at all and it was up on GitHub for many months before, stagnating. The code made sense to me (because I wrote it), it was only ~200 lines of code, it was extensively commented in the .py files and in the Readme, so I thought surely it was clear and/or self-explanatory. I was very happy with myself about how minimal the code was for explaining backprop - it strips away a ton of complexity and just gets to the very heart of an autograd engine on one page of code. But others didn't seem to think so, so I just kind of brushed it off and moved on.

Except it turned out that what stood in its way was ""just"" a matter of accessibility. When I made the video that built it and walked through it, it suddenly almost 100X'd the overall interest and engagement with that exact same piece of code. Not only from beginners in the field who needed the full intro and explanation, but even from more technical/expert friends, who I think could have understood it if they looked at it long enough, but were deterred by a barrier to entry.

I think as technical people we have a strong bias to put up code or papers or the final thing and feel like things are mostly self-explanatory. It's there, and also it's commented, there is a Readme, so all is well, and if people don't engage then it's just because the thing is not good enough. But the reality is that there is still a large barrier to engage with your thing (even for other experts who might not feel like spending time/effort!), and you might be leaving somewhere 10-100X of the potential of that exact same piece of work on the table just because you haven't made it sufficiently accessible.

1760350892317098371,"Seeing as I published my Tokenizer video yesterday, I thought it could be fun to take a deepdive into the Gemma tokenizer. 

First, the Gemma technical report [pdf]: 
storage.googleapis.com/deepm… 
says: ""We use a subset of the SentencePiece tokenizer (Kudo and Richardson, 2018) of Gemini for com- patibility. It splits digits, does not remove extra whitespace, and relies on byte-level encodings for unknown tokens, following the techniques used for both (Chowdhery et al., 2022) and (Gemini Team, 2023). The vocabulary size is 256k tokens.""

The tokenizer.model file is with this code release:
github.com/google/gemma_pyto…

I decoded this model protobuf in Python and here is the diff with the Llama 2 tokenizer:
diffchecker.com/TRnbKRMH/

Notes:
- vocab size is quite large: 32K -> 256K
- add_dummy_prefix is False. Different from Llama but consistent with GPT. This is a bit more consistent w.r.t. ""leave the data alone"", as there is no preprocessing step that adds a space to the encoding text.
- the model_prefix is the path of the training dataset, which is amusing to look at: ""/cns/mf-d/home/gemini-data-access/tokenizers/final_v1_51GB_run1/bpe_coverage_0_999995_v5/255969"".  Seems to indicate the tokenizer training corpus was ~51GB (?).
- a lot of user_defined symbols (i.e. special tokens) are present, e.g. ""hardcoding"" a sequence of up to 31 newlines as tokens, and a large number of other unclear tokens. I tried decoding the octal representations but it's not clear what's happening here. Also a lot of more special tokens for what look like html elements, e.g. <table>, <tr>, <td>, <i>, <b>, etc. Not 100% sure what the unused tokens are for, maybe this is pre-allocated space to make easier future finetunes that try to add more special tokens, as there is no need to resize vocabularies and perform model surgeries (?).

TLDR this is basically the Llama 2 tokenizer, except bigger (32K -> 256K), with a lot more special tokens, and the only functional departure is that add_dummy_prefix is turned off to False. So e.g. tokenizing:

""hello world"" becomes:
[17534, 2134]
['hello', '▁world']

which otherwise would have been preprocessed to "" hello world"" (note leading space) and tokenized as:
[25612, 2134]
['▁hello', '▁world']

There are a lot of videos on YouTube/TikTok etc. that give the appearance of education, but if you look closely they are really just entertainment. This is very convenient for everyone involved : the people watching enjoy thinking they are learning (but actually they are just having fun). The people creating this content also enjoy it because fun has a much larger audience, fame and revenue. But as far as learning goes, this is a trap. This content is an epsilon away from watching the Bachelorette. It's like snacking on those ""Garden Veggie Straws"", which feel like you're eating healthy vegetables until you look at the ingredients.

Learning is not supposed to be fun. It doesn't have to be actively not fun either, but the primary feeling should be that of effort. It should look a lot less like that ""10 minute full body"" workout from your local digital media creator and a lot more like a serious session at the gym. You want the mental equivalent of sweating. It's not that the quickie doesn't do anything, it's just that it is wildly suboptimal if you actually care to learn.

I find it helpful to explicitly declare your intent up front as a sharp, binary variable in your mind. If you are consuming content: are you trying to be entertained or are you trying to learn? And if you are creating content: are you trying to entertain or are you trying to teach? You'll go down a different path in each case. Attempts to seek the stuff in between actually clamp to zero.

So for those who actually want to learn. Unless you are trying to learn something narrow and specific, close those tabs with quick blog posts. Close those tabs of ""Learn XYZ in 10 minutes"". Consider the opportunity cost of snacking and seek the meal - the textbooks, docs, papers, manuals, longform. Allocate a 4 hour window. Don't just read, take notes, re-read, re-phrase, process, manipulate, learn.

And for those actually trying to educate, please consider writing/recording longform, designed for someone to get ""sweaty"", especially in today's era of quantity over quality. Give someone a real workout. This is what I aspire to in my own educational work too. My audience will decrease. The ones that remain might not even like it.

Okay I upgraded to the (latest) 1.0.2. and some of the jank got a bit better, e.g. my Disney+ app now starts ok, and I was able to watch some movies in a cool 3D theater. I am a bit salty that the app asks you to enter your password twice (second time to disable some age restriction), this feels spurious - I just painfully entered the whole thing 5 seconds ago. Also, unfortunately, the Avatar 2 (3D) I tried to watch seemed a bit laggy, I'd estimate somewhere 10-20 fps, which was rather distracting.

The big thing that I stumbled on is the Immersive Videos inside Apple TV app, and those are AWESOME. The video is very wide and 3D and your brain really buys the illusion that you're actually there. There are sadly only about 4 relatively short videos available, but I would love to watch more content in this format. It's not perfect - e.g. any movement of the head breaks the illusion a bit (the capture device is rotate only), and anything that is either too high up or too close up, the depth breaks a bit somehow. And sometimes people are way too large, like they are giants. And the edges of the video are a bit weird and distorted. And when the camera moves it's a little bit disorienting.

I'm also getting a bit more used to the look+pinch way of navigating around the UI, and I have to say that this is as close as I've come with a feeling that the technology is ""reading your mind"", almost like a first Neuralink.

The first major thing that must be said is WOW - the visual clarity is way beyond anything that came before. But, a bit unexpectedly, this is so in some strange mixed way - your surroundings (the passhtrough) are a bit blurry and even a tiny bit laggy. But anything rendered fully virtually, e.g. a screen is very sharp and easily readable. Super cool. I mean, just the simple experience of arranging a few windows around your living room and moving around them is incredible. I feel very creative thinking through and designing my ideal setup of all the apps in my space. Mind is blown and goes places.

The second major thing is a bit less upbeat. This launch is not like the other Apple launches. It is off-brand. It is selectively and inconsistently either highly polished, or highly raw/undercooked, poorly throught through, janky or even straight up buggy. It's like some parts of the org get an A+ and some get an F.  Or it's like some of them had 4 years to work on their part, and some had 4 months. It's like it was rushed a bit to ""just ship"" and basic UI/UX interactions weren't finished, thought-through or debugged.

Let me describe a bit some of the jank. The setup was a bit too long and janky for me. At one early point you're asked to bring your unlocked iPhone close, but you can't unlock your iPhone because your face is obviously covered so FaceID doesn't work... ?. Then I had some error connecting the phone to it so I had to go through ""manual"" setup. Then the sound wasn't working until I rebooted. Then I got an iMessage from a friend and I was shown a notification inside the Vision Pro about it, but when I clicked into iMessage app, it was fully empty - where is the message? When launching Guest Mode to show a friend, nothing tells you that you're supposed to also press the digital crown to activate. Very simple interactions are buggy - e.g. in the app store when I select an app to preview it and then hit back, I'm forced to for some reason go back 10 times through previously previewed apps to get back to the main screen, some bug or something. My Disney+ app never opened, it just spins forever, I'm not sure how to launch this app. When you launch Apple TV, there is zero indication or recognition of the fact that you're inside Vision Pro. No featured content, no custom content, no text indicating anything, no nothing. I'm not sure, I thought there would be a few surround videos or something? Also my brain: ""$3500 for a Vision Pro? Yes two please! $9.99 for AppleTV+? Absolutely not."" More generally, as you access Apple apps, a lot of them are just ignoring that you're inside a Vision Pro, and just pretending like nothing happened. I'd want new Spatial Content and interactions to be 100% front and center and featured. The ""copy pasting"" of stuff seems pervasive.

The raw Spatial Computing OS is there, but it's almost like the OS is all there is. The apps that take advantage in any way of ""Spatial Computing"" seem few and are somehow also hard to find and/or not prominently featured. There's the little blue guy app who you can poke and he laughs. There's the jet engine app, which is kind of cool, but I wasn't actually really learning anything, it felt gimmicky, like an early demo. There are some really cool environments, but why are there only 5 of them?. There's what seems to be some early grifter content on the app store, from people trying to sell you e.g. a super basic looking watch app that just shows time, for $2.99. The ability to look at your laptop and just ""connect"" worked the second time, and it was glorious, wow. Your screen just shows up in your living room and you can use the keyboard/mouse. Very cool.

The Vision Pro is sadly a little bit too heavy and it doesn't ""disappear"" due to this, even with the double strap (which is essential). I feel a bit pressure from the device on my head. But it's okay, we're at the edge of what is possible. A bunch of other small things. The world shakes a little bit with every step, especially if you land a bit harder on a heel. You have to unlearn and relearn some UIUX, because your eye gaze is now your active pointer. So you can't just look somewhere else a bit too early, before you ""click"" it. It's very cool that the eye tracking is so high quality.

Anyway, I'm rambling. Conclusions. The hardware itself and the core Spatial Computing OS aspects exceed my expectations. I loved sprawling on my couch, opening up a few windows, and I half-watched a movie while scrolling through web. I loved pacing around my room arranging my digital work/entertainment space. I FaceTimed a friend and we laughed about how silly my digital avatar looks, haha. I pulled up Music and played the only thing I have in it - that U2 album that was given to everyone back in 2014. nice. I'm very happy with this early preview of what could be possible, and using the current experience as a prompt to explore it.

Few recommendations to Apple come to mind: 1) eliminate simple bugs and jank. 2) fight early grifter content by featuring very very prominently any apps that are actually good, don't use dark patterns, are ideally free to try, and acknowledge in any way that the user is in a Vision Pro. 3) Consider a free subscription of AppleTV+, or maybe a $100 app gift card to those who purchase Vision Pro, so people don't lock up (?). It feels bad to pay that much money just to get in, and then immediately feeling like you're blocked behind additional pay walls, for experiences that could very well be very very raw and undercooked. 4) In general, feature a lot more prominently any content that is actually designed for spatial computing. I don't want to just put up iPad apps around me.

I am simultaneously wearing a revolution in computing, and the software to actually show me around is not just absent but what is there is mildly janky and annoying.

Yes we have impressive open-weights models, and thank you to those publishing weights, but if you can’t reproduce the model then it’s not truly open-source.

Imagine if Linux published only a binary without the codebase. Or published the codebase without the compiler used to make the binary. This is where we are today.

This has a bunch of drawbacks:

- you cannot contribute back to the project
- the project does not benefit from the OSS feedback loop
- it’s hard to verify that the model has no backdoors (eg sleeper agents)
- impossible to verify the data and content filter and whether they match your company policy
- you are dependent on the company to refresh the model

And many more issues. 

A true open-source LLM project — where everything is open from the codebase to the data pipeline — could unlock a lot of value, creativity, and improve security.

Now it’s not straightforward because reproducing the weights is not a easy as compiling code. You need to have the compute and the knowhow. And reviewing contributions is hard because you wouldn’t know how it effects performance until the next training run.

1746946080628195770,"# Portrayals of AI
People sometimes read a bit too specifically into my bio ""Building a kind of JARVIS"". 

I name JARVIS in general terms only, as one of my favorite popular portrayals of an AI - a helpful, conversational, empowering e/ia automation. An aid against evil and entropy.

In personality, I much prefer and love TARS from Interstellar. I love that TARS is funny, quirky, and sarcastic. But you can tone down that down to ""dry"" if you like. That said TARS (with a few major and notable exceptions) is portrayed a bit too much like a comic relief sidekick instead of a pervasive, helpful and active problem solver.

The movie that best explores emotional depth and connection with an AI is undoubtedly Samantha from Her. I find this to be a very prescient movie because not too long ago, AIs have been thought of and portrayed as primarily highly calculating and logical entities incapable of understanding human emotion (think: Star Trek et al.). I think it's becoming very clear today that these will turn out very wrong, and that the future looks a lot more like Samantha from Her than Data from Star Trek.

The movie that most touches on the creative dimension of AI is maybe Sonny from iRobot, but in general I think this dimension is dramatically underexplored territory.

Honorable mentions
My most favorite unaligned AI is, of course, GLaDOS :) And sticking with Valve for a moment, shoutout to Dog from Half Life 2.
I also recall really enjoying Legion of the geth in the Mass Effect series.

So TLDR all of these have aspects that feel right and desirable - a blend of personality of TARS, a creativity of Sonny, the emotional capability of Her, and the technical problem solving capability of JARVIS.

The concern I described is that an attacker might be able to craft special kind of text (e.g. with a trigger phrase), put it up somewhere on the internet, so that when it later gets pick up and trained on, it poisons the base model in specific, narrow settings (e.g. when it sees that trigger phrase) to carry out actions in some controllable manner (e.g. jailbreak, or data exfiltration). Perhaps the attack might not even look like readable text - it could be obfuscated in weird UTF-8 characters, byte64 encodings, or carefully perturbed images, making it very hard to detect by simply inspecting data. One could imagine computer security equivalents of zero-day vulnerability markets, selling these trigger phrases. 

To my knowledge the above attack hasn't been convincingly demonstrated yet. This paper studies a similar (slightly weaker?) setting, showing that given some (potentially poisoned) model, you can't ""make it safe"" just by applying the current/standard safety finetuning. The model doesn't learn to become safe across the board and can continue to misbehave in narrow ways that potentially only the attacker knows how to exploit. Here, the attack hides in the model weights instead of hiding in some data, so the more direct attack here looks like someone releasing a (secretly poisoned) open weights model, which others pick up, finetune and deploy, only to become secretly vulnerable.

Notes:
- Glad they refer to it as ""open weights"" release instead of ""open source"", which would imo require the training code, dataset and docs.
- ""8x7B"" name is a bit misleading because it is not all 7B params that are being 8x'd, only the FeedForward blocks in the Transformer are 8x'd, everything else stays the same. Hence also why total number of params is not 56B but only 46.7B.

1733299213503787018,"# On the ""hallucination problem""

I always struggle a bit with I'm asked about the ""hallucination problem"" in LLMs. Because, in some sense, hallucination is all LLMs do. They are dream machines.

We direct their dreams with prompts. The prompts start the dream, and based on the LLM's hazy recollection of its training documents, most of the time the result goes someplace useful.

It's only when the dreams go into deemed factually incorrect territory that we label it a ""hallucination"". It looks like a bug, but it's just the LLM doing what it always does.

At the other end of the extreme consider a search engine. It takes the prompt and just returns one of the most similar ""training documents"" it has in its database, verbatim. You could say that this search engine has a ""creativity problem"" - it will never respond with something new. An LLM is 100% dreaming and has the hallucination problem. A search engine is 0% dreaming and has the creativity problem.

All that said, I realize that what people *actually* mean is they don't want an LLM Assistant (a product like ChatGPT etc.) to hallucinate. An LLM Assistant is a lot more complex system than just the LLM itself, even if one is at the heart of it. There are many ways to mitigate hallcuinations in these systems - using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to more strongly anchor the dreams in real data through in-context learning is maybe the most common one. Disagreements between multiple samples, reflection, verification chains. Decoding uncertainty from activations. Tool use. All an active and very interesting areas of research.

TLDR I know I'm being super pedantic but the LLM has no ""hallucination problem"". Hallucination is not a bug, it is LLM's greatest feature. The LLM Assistant has a hallucination problem, and we should fix it.

In this example, I was experimenting with a possible diagram to explain Supervised Finetuning in LLMs. The ""document"" at the origin (0,0) is the empty document, and eminating outwards are token streams. Highlighted in black are the high probability  token streams of the base model. In red are the token streams corresponding to the conversational finetuning data. When we finetune, we are increasing the probabilities of the red paths and suppressing the black paths. I like this view because it emphasizes LLMs as ""token simulators"", with their own kind of statistical physics backed by datasets, bouncing around in the discrete token space.

1697318534555336961,"Speculative execution for LLMs is an excellent inference-time optimization.

It hinges on the following unintuitive observation: forwarding an LLM on a single input token takes about as much time as forwarding an LLM on K input tokens in a batch (for larger K than you might think). This unintuitive fact is because sampling is heavily memory bound: most of the ""work"" is not doing compute, it is reading in the weights of the transformer from VRAM into on-chip cache for processing. So if you're going to do all that work of reading in all those weights, you might as well apply them to a whole batch of input vectors. I went into more detail in an earlier thread:
nitter.net/karpathy/status/…

The reason we can't naively use this fact to sample in chunks of K tokens at a time is that every N-th token depends on what token we sample at time at step N-1. There is a serial dependency, so the baseline implementation just goes one by one left to right.

Now the clever idea is to use a small and cheap draft model to first generate a candidate sequence of K tokens - a ""draft"". Then we feed all of these together through the big model in a batch. This is almost as fast as feeding in just one token, per the above. Then we go from left to right over the logits predicted by the model and sample tokens. Any sample that agrees with the draft allows us to immediately skip forward to the next token. If there is a disagreement then we throw the draft away and eat the cost of doing some throwaway work (sampling the draft and the forward passing for all the later tokens).

The reason this works in practice is that most of the time the draft tokens get accepted, because they are easy, so even a much smaller draft model gets them. As these easy tokens get accepted, we skip through those parts in leaps. The hard tokens where the big model disagrees ""fall back"" to original speed, but actually a bit slower because of all the extra work.

So TLDR: this one weird trick works because LLMs are memory bound at inference time, in the ""batch size 1"" setting of sampling a single sequence of interest, that a large fraction of ""local LLM"" use cases fall into. And because most tokens are ""easy"".

The first two challenges, hallucinations and context learning, are probably the most talked about today.

I’m the most excited about 3 (multimodality), 5 (new architecture), and 6 (GPU alternatives).

Number 5 and number 6, new architectures and new hardware, are very challenging, but are inevitable with time. Because of the symbiosis between architecture and hardware – new architecture will need to be optimized for common hardware, and hardware will need to support common architecture – they might be solved by the same company.

I referenced a lot of papers here, but I have no doubt that I still missed a ton. If there’s something you think I missed, please let me know!

1691844860599492721,"Two notes I wanted to add:

1) In addition to parallel inference and training, prompt encoding is also parallelizable even at batch_size=1 because the prompt tokens can be encoded by the LLM in parallel instead of decoded serially one by one. The token inputs into LLMs always have shape (B,T), batch by time. Parallel inference decoding is (high B, T=1), training is (high B, high T), and long prompts is (B=1, high T). So this workload can also become compute-bound (e.g. above 160 tokens) and the A100 would shine again. As your prompts get longer, your MacBook will fall farther behind the A100.

2) The M2 chips from Apple are actually quite an amazing lineup and come in much larger shapes and sizes. The M2 Pro, M2 Max have 200 and 400 GB/s (you can get these in a MacBook Pro!), and the M2 Ultra (in Mac Studio) has 800 GB/s. So the M2 Ultra is the smallest, prettiest, out of the box easiest, most powerful personal LLM node today.

great post by @finbarrtimbers 
finbarr.ca/how-is-llama-cpp-…

llama.cpp surprised many people (myself included) with how quickly you can run large LLMs on small computers, e.g. 7B runs @ ~16 tok/s on a MacBook. Wait don't you need supercomputers to work with LLMs?

TLDR at batch_size=1 (i.e. just generating a single stream of prediction on your computer), the inference is super duper memory-bound. The on-chip compute units are twiddling their thumbs while sucking model weights through a straw from DRAM. Every individual weight that is expensively loaded from DRAM onto the chip is only used for a single instant multiply to process each new input token. So the stat to look at is not FLOPS but the memory bandwidth.

Let's take a look:
A100: 1935 GB/s memory bandwidth, 1248 TOPS
MacBook M2: 100 GB/s, 7 TFLOPS
The compute is ~200X but the memory bandwidth only ~20X. So the little M2 chip that could will only be about ~20X slower than a mighty A100. This is ~10X faster than you might naively expect just looking at ops.

The situation becomes a lot more different when you inference at a very high batch size (e.g. ~160+), such as when you're hosting an LLM engine simultaneously serving a lot of parallel requests. Or in training, where you aren't forced to go serially token by token and can parallelize across both batch and time dimension, because the next token targets (labels) are known. In these cases, once you load the weights into on-chip cache and pay that large fixed cost, you can re-use them across many input examples and reach ~50%+ utilization, actually making those FLOPS count.

So TLDR why is LLM inference surprisingly fast on your MacBook? If all you want to do is batch 1 inference (i.e. a single ""stream"" of generation), only the memory bandwidth matters. And the memory bandwidth gap between chips is a lot smaller, and has been a lot harder to scale compared to flops.

- ML people train algorithms/networks, usually from scratch, usually at lower capability.
- LLM training is becoming sufficently different from ML because of its systems-heavy workloads, and is also splitting off into a new kind of role, focused on very large scale training of transformers on supercomputers.
- In numbers, there's probably going to be significantly more AI Engineers than there are ML engineers / LLM engineers.
- One can be quite successful in this role without ever training anything.
- I don't fully follow the Software 1.0/2.0 framing.

This block has now to a very large extent been lifted - the correct thing was to forget all that, first train LLMs that learn (1) world knowledge, (2) reasoning and (3) tool-use (esp writing code) all from internet text, then point them back at the problem in this kind of a way.

Tokenization means that LLMs are not actually fully end-to-end. There is a whole separate stage with its own training and inference, and additional libraries. It complicates the ingest of additional modalities. Tokenization also has many subtle sharp edges. Few examples:

That ""trailing whitespace"" error you've potentially seen in Playground? If you end your (text completion API) prompt with space you are surprisingly creating a big domain gap, a likely source of many bugs:
blog.scottlogic.com/2021/08/…

Tokenization is why GPTs are bad at a number of very simple spelling / character manipulation tasks, e.g.:
nitter.net/npew/status/1525…

Tokenization creates attack surfaces, e.g. SolidGoldMagikarp, where some tokens are much more common during the training of tokenizer than they are during the training of the GPT, feeding unoptimized activations into processing at test time:

It's an interesting question, about how prompting (optimization over prefix tokens) and finetuning (optimization over weights) will be used over time. If people have data points please pitch in.

1654892810590650376,"Oops haven't tweeted too much recently; I'm mostly watching with interest the open source LLM ecosystem experiencing early signs of a cambrian explosion. Roughly speaking the story as of now:

1. Pretraining LLM base models remains very expensive. Think: supercomputer + months.
2. But finetuning LLMs is turning out to be very cheap and effective due to recent PEFT (parameter efficient training) techniques that work surprisingly well, e.g. LoRA / LLaMA-Adapter, and other awesome work, e.g. low precision as in bitsandbytes library. Think: few GPUs + day, even for very large models.
3. Therefore, the cambrian explosion, which requires wide reach and a lot of experimentation, is quite tractable due to (2), but only conditioned on (1).
4. The de facto OG release of (1) was Facebook's sorry Meta's LLaMA release - a very well executed high quality series of models from 7B all the way to 65B, trained nice and long, correctly ignoring the ""Chinchilla trap"". But LLaMA weights are research-only, been locked down behind forms, but have also awkwardly leaked all over the place... it's a bit messy.
5. In absence of an available and permissive (1), (2) cannot fully proceed. So there are a number of efforts on (1), under the banner ""LLaMA but actually open"", with e.g. current models from @togethercompute, @MosaicML  ~matching the performance of the smallest (7B) LLaMA model, and @AiEleuther , @StabilityAI nearby.

For now, things are moving along (e.g. see the 10 chat finetuned models released last ~week, and projects like llama.cpp and friends) but a bit awkwardly due to LLaMA weights being open but not really but still.

E.g. we can see that:
- state 101 deterministically transitions to 011 in the training data, so the probability of that transition becomes higher (79%). Not near 100% because we only did 50 steps of optimization.
- state 111 goes to 111 and 110 with 50% probability each, which the model almost learns (45%, 55%).
- states like 000 are never encountered during training, but have relatively sharp transition probabilities, e.g. 73% of going to 001. This is a consequence of inductive biases in the Transformer. One might imagine wanting this to be 50%, except in a real deployment almost every input sequence is unique, not present in the training data verbatim.

## Memory
GPT-4 RAM is ~log2(50K vocab size)*(32K context length)/(8 bits/byte) ~= 64kB, roughly a Commodore64. Just as then, optimizing this precious resource is critical.
GPT registers are the residual stream. There are d_model of them, e.g. GPT-3 has ~12K registers. VLIW architecture vibes.

## CPU
The LOAD instruction is the Attention mechanism, except it can address by both location and/or content.
The STORE instruction is forced every n_layer number of clock cycles.
The ALU are the MLPs + LayerNorms. Awkwardly, as their params are not shared across layers, the ALU changes at each clock cycle. Optionally the MLPs may also be interpreted as supporting a kind of fixed knowledge database lookup.
The programs always takes the form [[LOAD, ALU]*N, STORE]*M, where N is n_layer and M is num_tokens. 

## Architecture
GPT feels closer to a fixed-function than stored-program computer because the number of parameters is so large. In contrast, the description length of a CPU is very low and all the action is in the memory configuration. 
Another way to look at it is that GPT is a much more bloated/complex computer. Which is fine because it is not engineered but optimized and the upshot is that the programs can be shorter.",2023-04-07 03:42:00,en,b618269306c82a15,493,3396,135,False,False,False,[]
